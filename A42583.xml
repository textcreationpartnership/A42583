            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>All peoples</hi> will walk every one in the <hi>name</hi> of his <hi>gods:</hi> And let it be our reſolution, to walk in the <hi>name, nature,</hi> or <hi>being</hi> of the Lord our God for ever and ever; to be <hi>holy</hi> as he is <hi>holy, pure</hi> as he is <hi>pure, merciful</hi> as he is <hi>merciful, perfect</hi> as he our heavenly Father is <hi>perfect.</hi>

            <p>Even thus it comes to paſs in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when <hi>Eliſha</hi> is dead and buried there. Thus it falls out in the <hi>Church,</hi> when the Lord Jeſus, (God

            <p>But where it is ſaid, <hi>they let him down,</hi> we ſhall finde no ſuch matter either in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, or Greek, or Chaldee, or Latin Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation. The Hebrew text hath <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>when he was therein,</hi> and the <hi>Geneva</hi> Bible turns it, <hi>when he was down:</hi> our laſt tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>lets him down gently.</hi> The Tigurin, French, and ſome of our old Engliſh tranſlations <hi>tumble him down for haſte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what need all this curioſity? I dare not depart from the <hi>letter</hi> of the Scripture, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten <hi>mine own ſenſe</hi> upon it, as many of theſe have done: And indeed it is neer a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to themſelves. For firſt they ſay, <hi>They caſt the man</hi> into the Sepulchre, which muſt be in part for fear of the <hi>Moabites:</hi> and then they ſay, <hi>they let him down,</hi> which muſt be gently and leiſurely. The holy Spirit of God oftentimes intends a myſtery, and ſo leaves the <hi>letter</hi> ſeemingly abſurd. Such <hi>ſeeming abſurdities</hi> as theſe, are leſt for the honour of Gods <hi>Spirit,</hi> which clears the difficulties, and ſets all right. This man is called twice <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>The words are thus to be rendred. <hi>And the man went and touched the bones of Eliſha.</hi> Firſt, <hi>He went.</hi> Secondly, <hi>He touched.</hi> 1. He went.

               <hi>he went</hi> and <hi>touched the bones of Eliſha.</hi> The Lord requires of us not only a <hi>mortification and dying unto ſin, but alſo a burial of all ſin.</hi> They are two Articles of the Faith: 1.

               </gap> 
               <hi>Conjecture.</hi> This liberty is taken oftentimes by our Tranſlators, as when they <hi>adde,</hi> or <hi>take away,</hi> or <hi>invert and change the order of the words.</hi> Wee ſhall meet with examples of all theſe kindes. I ſhall name one of each, and leave the courteous Reader to his own obſervation of other like.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt kinde,<note place="margin">Matth. <hi>20.</hi> v. <hi>23.</hi> Mark <hi>10.</hi> v. <hi>40.</hi>

            <p>This Tranſlation makes our Lord abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deny, that he hath any <hi>power</hi> to give the honour of <hi>ſitting at his right hand and left;</hi> and ſo they rob the Lord Jeſus of his <hi>Regalia,</hi> his <hi>Royalties,</hi> and thoſe <hi>honours</hi> which he hath right and authority to beſtow.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65717:8"/>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides, they wholly diſcourage the <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers</hi> of the Lord Jeſus: For what <hi>Souldier</hi> will follow that <hi>Commander in Chief,</hi> who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is at <hi>preſent</hi> able; nor for the <hi>future</hi> will be able to reward him? <hi>Saul</hi> knew what was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent motive with ſuch men, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.7. Will the ſon of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> give unto every one of you, Fields or Vineyards, and make you all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains of thouſands, and Captains of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds?

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="4">4. They make the Lord Jeſus ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, and gain-ſay that in theſe words,
<pb facs="tcp:65717:9"/>which elſewhere he frequently affirms; as I ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
            <p>Meantime, our laſt Tranſlators were not the prime Leaders into this Error, but were themſelves miſ-lead by others; as <hi>Vatablus, Piſcator, Beza,</hi> and the Miniſters of <hi>Geneva</hi> who tranſlated the French Bible; to name no more. <hi>Piſcator</hi> tells us, there is an <hi>Ellipſis</hi> which is to be <hi>ſupplyed,</hi> by theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which our Tranſlators follow, and adde, <hi>It ſhall be given.</hi> I render the words thus, leaving out the <hi>Supplement [it ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;]</hi> To ſit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give, but (or, <hi>unleſs</hi>) to thoſe for whom it is prepared of my Father.</p>
            <p>Theſe words of our Lord then are not any <hi>denial,</hi> that he hath <hi>power or right to give,</hi> but an <hi>Exception</hi> only. He ſaith not abſolutely, <hi>It is not mine to give;</hi> but, <hi>It it is not mine to give unleſs, or except</hi> unto thoſe for whom it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; as in the parallel we read, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.40. to a word; which text is alſo corrupted by the ſame <hi>Supplement.</hi> That which deceived the Tranſlators, was; they conſidered not, that <gap reason="foreign">

So that the Lord Jeſus denied not, that the divine <hi>honours</hi> were <hi>his to give,</hi> but only that they <hi>were not his to give to others then thoſe</hi> for whom they were prepared. And this Tranſlation ſutes extream well with the context. The Diſciples would have had the Crown of glory before they had ſtriven for it. No, ſaith our Lord, it is not <hi>prepared for ſuch;</hi> It is not mine to give <hi>unleſs</hi> to thoſe, <hi>for whom it is prepared of my Father;</hi> that is, for thoſe who ſuffer with the <hi>Son, Rom.</hi> 8.17. And as this agrees well with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, ſo with diverſe other tranſlations, as the Syriac and Arabic, and that of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and that of the Low Dutch, and the Spaniſh tranſlation, <hi>Pagnin</hi> alſo, <hi>Caſtellio,</hi> and <hi>Tremel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius:</hi> ſome alſo of our old Engliſh tranſlations have hit upon it; as that of <hi>Coverdale,</hi> and that dedicated to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth. And here the Authors of the late Engiiſh <hi>Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were in the right, who ſay thus; Chriſts power of diſpoſing of it, is not denyed; but he ſheweth only, <hi>to whom it is to be given.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwerably hereunto we may ſay, <hi>To ſit on Chriſts right hand and on his left, is Christs to give to thoſe for whom it is prepared.</hi> This Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is point blank contradictory unto that ſenſe which our Tranſlators have given of the words; <hi>To ſit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65717:10"/>
            <p>Now that Chriſt hath right, and <hi>de facto,</hi> that he doth and ſhall beſtow the divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of his kingdom, upon perſons duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, appears evidently by <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.28. <hi>Ye who have followed me in the regeneration, ſhall ſit on twelve Thrones, &amp;c. Luke</hi> 22.29. I diſpoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you a kingdom, &amp;c. Father I will, that they, whom thou haſt given me, be with me, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 17.24. The reaſon why the Lord Jeſus hath this <hi>right</hi> to confer divine <hi>honours</hi> upon his <hi>followers, to ſet them on his right hand and on his left,</hi> may be conſidered from the vertue and merit of his fufferings. For as a ſon, while yet under his fathers immediate authority, <hi>Quicquid acquirit, acquirit patri,</hi> what he gets, he gets for his father. But if the ſon get ſpoil in the wars, with hazard of his life, which the Civilians call <hi>Peculium caſtrenſe,</hi> that is properly the ſons own. And thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord Jeſus deſcended into the lower parts of the earth, was dead and buried, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.9. when he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive &amp; <hi>gave gifts unto men.</hi> Which was figured by <hi>David, diſtributing his ſpoils to his friends,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. Yea, our Lord ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly and properly to this purpoſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. To him that overcometh, <hi>will I give to ſit in my throne, even as I have overcome, and ſit in my Fathers throne.</hi>

            <p>By all this which hath been ſaid, its evident, that this <hi>Supplement, [It ſhall be given]</hi> to ſay no worſe of it, is a ſuperfluous: redundancy.</p>
            <p>We meet with an example of the ſecond kinde, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19, 20. which they render thus; my little children, let us not love in word,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 18.19.20</note> and in tongue, but in deed, and in truth. And hereby we know, that we are of the truth, and ſhall aſſure our hearts before him; <hi>For</hi> if our heart condemn us, God is greater then our heart, and knoweth all things.</p>
            <p>In the 20 verſe of this Paragraph, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] is twice found in the Greek text. The <hi>former</hi> the Tranſlators turn amiſs; the <hi>later</hi> they quite leave out. I would render and open thoſe words thus; <hi>My little children,</hi> let us not love in <hi>word,</hi> and in <hi>tongue,</hi> but in <hi>deed,</hi> and in <hi>truth.</hi> And herely (<hi>viz.</hi> by our <hi>loving</hi> in <hi>deed</hi> and in <hi>truth</hi>) we know that we are of the truth; and ſhall <hi>aſſure,</hi> or rather <hi>perſwade</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) our hearts before him: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Becauſe, if our heart condemn us, (<hi>viz.</hi> for any former failing inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto <hi>little children,</hi> to whom he directs thoſe words, ver. 18.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that</hi> God is greater then our heart, (namely, in wiſdom, grace, mercy, and goodneſs;) and knoweth all things, even the preſent frame and diſpoſition of our heart, <hi>in the truth of love.</hi> And this expoſition is moſt agreeable to the <hi>perſons</hi> to whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb facs="tcp:65717:11"/>writes, <hi>the little children;</hi> and to the <hi>duty</hi> which he exhorts them unto, <hi>to love in deed, and in truth:</hi> and to the <hi>effect</hi> of that <hi>duty,</hi> the <hi>aſſurance and perſwaſion</hi> of their hearts before God.</p>
            <p>Thus whereas many a poor ſoul <hi>dejects</hi> it ſelf, out of a meer <hi>miſtake</hi> of this Scripture ill rendred, and worſe underſtood, it being truly turn'd, and the genuine <hi>ſenſe</hi> thereof given, its a <hi>ſtrong conſolation to the little children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit, leſt theſe <hi>little children</hi> ſhould reſt in this <hi>age</hi> and <hi>eſtate,</hi> the Apoſtle proceeds; Beloved! if our heart <hi>condemn us not,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14. we have <hi>boldneſs</hi> (or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) towards God; and whatſoever we <hi>may ask,</hi> we receive of him; becauſe we keep his Commandements, and do thoſe things which are pleaſing in his ſight.</p>
            <p>An example of the third, (which is <hi>inverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the words,) is <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.34. which the Tranſlators render thus; Ye took <hi>joyfully</hi> the ſpoyling of your <hi>goods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 34.</note> 
               <hi>knowing in your ſelves,</hi> that ye have, in <hi>heaven,</hi> a better and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during ſubſtance. That we may the better know the miſ-tranſlation and undue <hi>inverſion</hi> of theſe words, we muſt underſtand, that the <hi>goods,</hi> whereof the Hebrews were <hi>ſpoyled,</hi> were either their <hi>temporal goods,</hi> whereof <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, he <hi>robbed</hi> either them, or other Churches,
<pb facs="tcp:65717:11"/>
               <hi>taking wages</hi> of them, to do ſervice to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians;</hi> the <hi>ſpoyling of theſe goods,</hi> the Hebrews took <hi>with joy.</hi> Or elſe,</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>goods</hi> may be alſo ſpiritually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and that in the worſt ſenſe; for ſuch as <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>ſeemingly,</hi> and to the yong profeſsing Hebrews. <hi>appeard to be their goods,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and truly were their <hi>evils.</hi> Such were the <hi>goods of Sodom,</hi> which <hi>Abraham</hi> would not receive or <hi>own, Gen.</hi> 14. The <hi>ſpoiling of theſe goods,</hi> by him who is <hi>Maher-Shalal Haſhbaz,</hi> who in <hi>haſtening the ſpoil,</hi> makes ſpeed to the prey, <hi>Eſay</hi> 8.3. the taking away theſe <hi>ſeeming goods,</hi> but <hi>true evils,</hi> the Hebrews took <hi>with joy</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>The <hi>inverſion</hi> of the Text, is in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knowing in your ſelves that ye have in heaven a better and enduring ſubſtance.</hi> A little labour ſometimes does a great deal of work. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Helm, turns the Ship quite another way. The ſame letters diſtributed and placed differently, make all the different words; and ſo the ſame words placed in a diverſe order, make extream different ſenſes. Such different ſenſes ariſe from the different placing the words of this text.</p>
            <p>For the words are <hi>inverted</hi> and changed from the genuine order of them, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb facs="tcp:65717:12"/>in the Greek. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which I render thus; Knowing that <hi>ye have in your ſelves</hi> better wealth in heaven, and that which will endure. What a difference is here? <hi>Knowing in your ſelves,</hi> that ye have in heaven a better, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This tranſlation perſwades men, that they ſhall have <hi>hereafter,</hi> in heaven, a better kinde of wealth. The true reading of theſe words, <hi>Knowing that you have in your ſelves, &amp;c.</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes believers to have already a <hi>real poſſeſsion</hi> of the better and enduring ſubſtance <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> ſo that they take the <hi>ſpoiling</hi> of their outward goods <hi>with joy.</hi> The words <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>in heaven,</hi> are not in the Vulg. Latin, nor in ſome of the Greek, nor Engliſh Manuſcripts. And with the Vulg. Latin agrees the French Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Spaniſh, and Italian, the High Dutch, and one Copy of the Low Dutch. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Pagnin</hi> and <hi>Vatablus,</hi> with the <hi>Tigurin</hi> Bible. Which <hi>order of words</hi> is wholly negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by all the printed Engliſh Tranſlations that I have yet ſeen: And hereby the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the holy Spirit is much obſcured, which <hi>points</hi> at the <hi>preſent and real poſſeſsion of the better and durable riches,</hi> which wiſdom hath and brings with her to the believing ſoul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.10. Ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cording to which, the <hi>poor</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>rich in faith and heires of the kingdom, Jam,</hi> 2.5. and <hi>rich</hi> towards God, <hi>Luke.</hi> 12.21.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65717:12"/>
            <p>What is here ſaid, that they <hi>have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better wealth,</hi> a learned Critick under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands to be only a <hi>right unto it hereafter: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur rem habere ad quam jus habent, loquendi genere etiam Juriſ-conſultis uſitato.</hi> But the <hi>uſual manner of ſpeech in Scripture,</hi> is not to be over-ruled by the <hi>uſual ſpeech of the Civil Lawyers.</hi> For the Scripture doth not entitle Gods people in <hi>a right to an eſtate in reverſion only,</hi> but enſtates them in a preſent and real poſſeſsion of the heavenly goods, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.4. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. For whereas the <hi>eternal life is the true riches,</hi> they who <hi>believe,</hi> have <hi>real poſſeſsion</hi> of it, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. and 5.24. &amp;c. and, by direct conſequence, they who <hi>love</hi> the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. if the poſture of <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>What reaſon can be rendred of this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſlation? No doubt but ſome there were, who rendred the words ſo, upon <hi>deſigne:</hi> Why? namely, for the avoiding and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of that (as too many eſteem it) exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable errour of <hi>inherent righteouſneſs;</hi> leſt any man ſhould collect from the true tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe words, <hi>that there is any righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, any goodneſs, any vertin in the people of God</hi> but what they have a right unto, that is <hi>reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> for them <hi>in heaven, till hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Adde unto theſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.51. The hoary
<pb facs="tcp:65717:13"/>head is a Crown of glory, <hi>if</hi> it be found in the way of righteouſneſs: That <hi>Supplement [if]</hi> overthrows the text.

            <p>Thus extream often they miſ-tranſlate [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] which is a <hi>Diſcretive,</hi> and render it by a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulative [and,]</hi> as <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. as I ſhew largely toward the end of this Book. But this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this errour, is ſo frequent in the tranſlation of the New Teſtament, that truly I have been weary of the obſervation; becauſe the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are ſo many, whereof ſome will appear in the enſuing Eſſay, which give me too often occaſion to complain.</p>
            <p>This fault is not ſmall, in proportion to the <hi>Particle;</hi> but indeed very great, as <hi>Logicians</hi> know; ſince the miſtaking of one of theſe, for the other, changes the nature of the <hi>Axiom</hi> or <hi>Sentence;</hi> and ſo perverts the Word of God. And may be accounted to thoſe <hi>little things,</hi> whoſe <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is <hi>ſmall,</hi> but which have <hi>great effects, James</hi> 3. That which lead them
<pb facs="tcp:65717:13"/>into this errour, may be the difficulty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>ſenſe</hi> of ſome <hi>diverſity,</hi> if left ſo. However, no doubt, it is better to deal faithfully and truly with the Scripture, and leave the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty as we finde it, then to force the <hi>text,</hi> and impoſe our own <hi>conjectures</hi> upon it, to make it ſeem <hi>ſenſe</hi> to us. For there may be even in ſuch words a good <hi>ſenſe</hi> intended by the Spirit, when yet there ſeems an abſurdity in the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as hath been ſhewen.</p>
            <p>Beſide theſe, there are many <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Hebrew, Greek, and other Tongues; many diverſe, yea, ſome contrary ſignifications con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under the ſame words, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Mercy;</hi> and according to ſome, <hi>unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſs,</hi> or <hi>reproach,</hi> as elſewhere, ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.34. whereof others doubt. In this caſe, Good men would wiſh, that what is beſt and moſt fit for the <hi>Context,</hi> might be put into it; but what ſeems to the Tranſlators for the preſent, to be not ſo proper, that it were put into the <hi>Margent.</hi> For the Scripture was-written for ſeveral <hi>Ages,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Worſhips;</hi> ſome <hi>Legal,</hi> ſome <hi>Evangelical;</hi> and conſequently given to ſeveral <hi>people;</hi> ſo that what ſeems ſevere, cruel, yea capital in one age, by a <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive precept,</hi> is diſalowable and laid aſide in another. Witneſs <hi>Luke</hi> 9.54.55. Wherfore elſe did the Jews perſecute <hi>Paul?</hi> Yea, why was
<pb facs="tcp:65717:14"/>it, that they who killed the Chriſtians, ſhould think, they did offer God an acceptable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>John</hi> 16.1.</p>
            <p>This the Tranſlators were aware of; and accordingly they have placed ſome different ſignifications in the <hi>Margent;</hi> but thoſe moſt-what the <hi>better;</hi> becauſe when <hi>truth</hi> is tryed by <hi>moſt voyces,</hi> it is commonly out-voted. And in that caſe, which is very often, it is rejected, and caſt into the <hi>Margent,</hi> as leſs proper to the <hi>Context:</hi> So that they very frequently put <hi>quid pro quo;</hi> and waive what makes againſt their <hi>private interpretations;</hi> and chooſe that for the <hi>Context</hi> which ſuits beſt with their own intereſt of opinion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give one or two inſtances of this.</p>
            <p>I finde often in the New Teſtament <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>diſobedient,</hi> rendred as all one with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving;</hi> which with <hi>ſome allowance,</hi> poſsibly might ſometime paſs, were not the former word turn'd <hi>unbelieving,</hi> upon a dangerous deſigne. For, whereas they underſtand <hi>faith in Chriſt</hi> a perſwaſion and <hi>belief,</hi> and that their ſins are remitted for Chriſts ſake, that he hath done and ſuffered all things for them, as compleatly as if they had done and ſuffered all in their own perſons; ſuch a <hi>faith</hi> leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for them to do or ſuffer <hi>out of obedience;</hi> as tis evident, the Apoſtle underſtands ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:65717:14"/>
               <hi>faith</hi> as brings forth obedience; and ſo he cals it <hi>obedience of faith, Rom.</hi> 1.5. and 16.27.</p>
            <p>Such an example we meet withal, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. He who believeth in the <hi>Son,</hi> hath the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life; but he who <hi>believeth not;</hi> the words are, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I ſhall name but one inſtance more of this kinde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. which they turn, Ye have obeyed that form of doctrine which <hi>was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto you.</hi> The Greek words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe words, is evidently contrary to the Greek <hi>Text;</hi> as it is clear by their own margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal acknowledgement. For the Greek words are thus rendred in the <hi>Margent,</hi> whereto <hi>ye were delivered:</hi> and as contrary to the <hi>ſcope</hi> and drift of the Apoſtle in thoſe words. For was that <hi>form of doctrine delivered unto them,</hi> that they might mold and faſhion it according to their own conceiving? as our Tranſlators too often have done; or were the Romans and we all <hi>delivered unto that form of doctrine,</hi> that we might be <hi>molded and faſhioned</hi> and made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable thereunto? as the Apoſtle here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly teacheth.</p>
            <p>Wherefore having obſerved many ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:65717:15"/>miſ-tranſlations <hi>byaſsing</hi> the holy <hi>Text,</hi> and making it to ſerve the Tranſlators <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> their <hi>Diana,</hi> their <hi>ruling opinions;</hi> (as, to the ſame end, the laſt Low Dutch tranſlation, how ever cryed up, it very much wreſts the holy Scripture, upon examination, as judicious and pious men affirm.) I thought it therefore a buſineſs well worthy my <hi>pains</hi> and beſt <hi>skill,</hi> and more <hi>time</hi> then I am likely to have in this world, to endeavour to the utmoſt, <hi>the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of the holy Scripture from falſe tranſlation, and miſ-interpretation;</hi> whether grounded thereupon, or upon <hi>true tranſlations;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it unto the Original tongues wherein it was firſt <hi>dictated</hi> by the <hi>holy Spirit of God;</hi> and <hi>ſpoken</hi> and written by the Penmen of the ſame <hi>Spirit.</hi> A work, I freely and ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge, very much above my ability; and ſuch as requires the labours of the moſt Pious and Learned men; howbeit, I was long preſſed in my ſpirit, nor indeed could I have reſt, until I had atempted ſomething herein, whereby I might <hi>give occaſion</hi> to men who are every way more able, and ſuch as have much more leiſure then my ſelf, both to <hi>amend</hi> what I have <hi>aſſayed</hi> to do, and to <hi>finiſh</hi> the work. Whereunto I doubt not but they will be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, if they ſhall conſider the neceſsity of an exact and perfect <hi>tranſlation</hi> of the holy Bible.
<pb facs="tcp:65717:16"/>It is true, that the holy Scriptures, in the firſt times of the Chriſtian Church, were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto all men all at once. For the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> wiſely conſidered how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly perillous it might be to expoſe the whole Scripture unto ignorant mens <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>judgement,</hi> or indeed, <hi>abuſe</hi> rather, and <hi>want of judgement:</hi> Surely more dangerous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious it might prove unto their <hi>ſouls,</hi> then to leave a whole Apothecaries Shop open to a diſeaſed perſon, who might as well chooſe and take <hi>deadly poyſon</hi> to his <hi>deſtruction,</hi> as a <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Medicine</hi> to the recovery of his <hi>health.</hi> And therefore they imparted unto the <hi>young believers,</hi> only ſome part or other of it, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as every one had need,</hi> and <hi>was able to hear;</hi> grounding this their practiſe on our Lords, <hi>John</hi> 16.12, 13. and his Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. whence it was, that they who were weak and not well rooted and grounded in the faith, for fear of death, delivered up thoſe books they had, to the Perſecutors; and thereupon they were called <hi>Libellorum traditores, Betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of thoſe little books of Scripture,</hi> which were imparted to them.</p>
            <p>Had the ſouls of men bin ſo carefully watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over by their Governours, and ſuch <hi>porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture</hi> wiſely and <hi>fatherly</hi> diſpenſed unto them, as might, with ſuch holy reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb facs="tcp:65717:16"/>have met with mens proficiency, ſurely ſuch prodigious Monſters had not been coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited out of the Word of God, by the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of opinion,</hi> as in theſe later dayes we have ſeen, and lament to ſee: <hi>Africa ſemper aliquid apportat novi;</hi> ſome hideous ſhape or other daily is <hi>brought forth;</hi> and every one <hi>fathered</hi> on the Scripture.</p>
            <p>What remedy remains for ſo great evils, God alone knowes, and will in his time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide. But ſince now all the holy Scripture is made publick unto every Nation, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon in his mother-tongue, without doubt a true and <hi>impartial</hi> tranſlation will do leſs hurt, and be more beneficial to mankind, then one <hi>wreſted</hi> and <hi>partial,</hi> which ſpeaks the language, and gives authority to one Sect or other, as our laſt doth.</p>
            <p>Yet is not all the blame to be laid upon the Tranſlators, but part of it to be ſhared with them alſo who ſet them a work; who by <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of State,</hi> limited them, (as ſome of them have much complained) leſt they might be thought, not to ſet forth a <hi>new Tranſlation,</hi> but rather a <hi>new Bible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, part of the blame ought to be laid on them, who <hi>undo</hi> that, which they had <hi>well done.</hi> For whereas many miſ-tranſlated words and phraſes, <hi>by plurality of voices,</hi> were carried into
<pb facs="tcp:65717:17"/>the <hi>Context,</hi> and the better Tranſlation moſt-what, was caſt into the <hi>Margent,</hi> thoſe <hi>margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal notes</hi> have been left out, together with the Apocrypha, to make the Bible <hi>portable, and fit for the Pocket.</hi> Yea, ſuch is the ignorance and boldneſs of ſome, that they have left out of their <hi>Impreſsions,</hi> the <hi>Apochryphal Scriptures;</hi> whereby they have gotten this whereof to glory; that they have <hi>done That</hi> which <hi>no wiſe or honeſt man hath ever done before them,</hi> (ſo far, as I have yet known,) or, I hope, will adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do after them.</p>
            <p>Nor ought this mine endeavour to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued, and thought preſumption; ſince I humbly thank the Searcher of my heart, I can truly ſay, what I have done, I have done it <hi>before the face of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 21.</note> in the integrity of my heart.

            <p>Nor indeed can any, who know my week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imployments, look for any other then <hi>plain work</hi> from me; but that ſuch as the Women call <hi>Plain-work,</hi> which is <hi>laſting, neceſſary,</hi> and <hi>handſom</hi> enough, and will, I believe, in time, <hi>work out</hi> all vain and ſuperfluous curioſities.</p>

            </p>
            <p>As for thoſe men, who now for many years, have rendred <hi>me odious</hi> unto ſuch as know me not; and have endeavoured to <hi>ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther me,</hi> like a Rat behinde the Hangings, traducing me, as <hi>a man of an erroneous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a dangerous man; one who turns the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures into Allegories, &amp;c.</hi> I heartily pray to the Lord for them, that he will incline their minds unto a <hi>right judgement;</hi> and that they may be
<pb facs="tcp:65717:18"/>truly ſuch, as they pretend and give forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be, <hi>Orthodox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But meantime, what means or way have I left me now in mine old age to approve my ſelf to be of a <hi>right judgement,</hi> beſide this <hi>Sori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina naenia,</hi> this free <hi>diſcovery</hi> of my ſelf unto thoſe who otherwiſe know me not? that all men, and eſpecially the godly learned may hereby judge, what my <hi>errours</hi> are; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am ſo <hi>dangerous</hi> a man to any but to the <hi>Devils kingdom;</hi> which, I confeſs, I endeavour to <hi>diſcover,</hi> &amp; by the ſpiritual armory mighty through God, utterly to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> in my ſelf and others. Let them alſo judge, whether <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the Fathers of the Church have not <hi>allegorized</hi> the Scriptures. Yea, whether it ought to be imputed as a <hi>fault</hi> unto the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> that they do <hi>Patrizare, imitate the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> and whether that, which was aſcribed as an <hi>ornament of praiſe</hi> unto them, ſhould be laid as a <hi>reproachful blemiſh,</hi> yea, and a <hi>crime</hi> upon their <hi>followers.</hi> And where the Apoſtle having <hi>allegorized</hi> many things in the Law, and ſaying <hi>[of which things I cannot now ſpeak particularly,]</hi> whether by this <gap reason="foreign">

            <pb facs="tcp:65717:19"/>
            <p>Howbeit I well know, I ſhall have many mouthes open againſt me; yet my comfort is, the teſtimony of my conſcience, that herein I <hi>ſerve God and my generation.</hi> Nor do I doubt but ſome there are, who will approve of my labours herein; yea, and many more, when the Day-ſtar is riſen, (whoſe light now dawns apace) will experimentally finde the truth of theſe things.</p>
            <p>Meantime I beſeech thoſe, who, in ſome things delivered in this work, are of a contrary judgement unto me, that, however <hi>I</hi> may be deſpicable in their eyes, yet, that they will not raſhly and haſtily condemn or ſlight what is preſented unto their view; but well weigh in the balance of the Sanctuary, what is here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto their ſerious conſideration, and that they would remember, they are not infallible; but that is poſsible, they may be deceived, as much as other men.</p>
            <p>But be the Work, and their opinion of it, what it will be; it muſt now <hi>ſtand or fall among men,</hi> according to the Readers opinion of it; <hi>Judicio Lectoris habent ſua fata Libelli.</hi> It is now at length come forth, but with great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, by reaſon of <hi>long expectation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit, ſo long delay is excuſable <hi>in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> if theſe things be conſidered: the <hi>length of the work; part of two ſharp Winters, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb facs="tcp:65717:19"/>the Preſs long time together; Intervention of other important and inſtant buſineſs at the Preſs; my neceſſary abſence and ſickneſs (Cauſa ſontica)</hi> diſabling me from furniſhing the Preſs ſome time <hi>with Copie;</hi> which truly (except three or four Sermons) then <hi>began to be,</hi> when it <hi>began to be printed;</hi> and like an haſty birth, was <hi>conceived, and born, written and printed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt together.</hi> Conſideration alſo may bee had of my manifold avocations incident in the interim unto my place and calling.</p>
            <p>Concerning the whole matter, thus much <hi>I</hi> ſeriouſly profeſs, that what is <hi>true</hi> and <hi>good</hi> in it, <hi>I</hi> own the <hi>good God,</hi> and <hi>God of truth</hi> for the <hi>Donor of it;</hi> who, <hi>I</hi> am well aſſured, hath been powerfully preſent with me in it: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, in regard of <hi>humane weakneſs,</hi> no man ſhall have <hi>a meaner opinion</hi> of it then <hi>I</hi> my ſelf have. However, ſo ſome good may be done toward the undeceiving, enlightning, informing, and edifying of thoſe who fear God; I value nor work it ſelf, nor pains, nor credit, nor time ſpent in it.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>I</hi> conclude this <hi>Preface, I</hi> muſt give the godly-learned Reader a more particular account of my <hi>Method, and way of proceeding in this Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>I</hi> was entring upon this Eſſay, <hi>I</hi> intended only an endeavour to make a <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaneous
<pb facs="tcp:65717:20"/>diſcovery</hi> of ſuch <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights in the Tranſlation, as were more groſs and notorious; and ſo to have obſerved either no <hi>Method</hi> at all, or that next to none, —<hi>ruere in medias res;</hi> to take them as <hi>I</hi> found them. But <hi>I</hi> corrected that intention, by conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how <hi>neceſſary a certain method is in all things:</hi> And that the <hi>Order</hi> wherein the Books of the Holy Scriptures are placed, muſt needs be the very beſt, and moſt ſatisfactory to all: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> reſolved upon that, and to take what miſ-tranſlations <hi>I</hi> ſhould finde in reading of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Howbeit foreſeeing that the work, by that means, would be <hi>very long,</hi> ſhould I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all <hi>overſights,</hi> amend them, and explain them at large. And on the contrary, that ſhould I only <hi>rectifie ſuch obliquity,</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, it would be very ſhort, and ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; <hi>I</hi> thought, that the <hi>Skeleton</hi> of meer <hi>Criticiſms</hi> (though they be more profitable then ſome men conceive, yet) would be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the <hi>Learned</hi> only.</p>
            <p>But ſince I ought to <hi>ſerve my generation,</hi> and to condeſcend unto the capacity of the meaneſt underſtanding, I have <hi>clothed that Skeleton of Criticiſms</hi> with ſuch moral <hi>Explications</hi> and <hi>Applications,</hi> as I thought needful to the <hi>uſe of edifying;</hi> if it ſo may pleaſe God, that the <hi>Spirit
<pb facs="tcp:65717:20"/>may enter, and the dead and dry bones may live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to follow the Clue of the Original Tongues, as <hi>Pagnin,</hi> and more exactly <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> have done. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome learned &amp; good men have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what condemned the later, as if he were too curious, and have affirmed, that he hath, in ſome places, made the Scripture ſcarce to ſpeak ſenſe; I confeſs, the Idioms of every Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and ſo of the Hebrew tongue, are ſuch, that they muſt ſeem harſh, if expreſſed in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Language. Yet I leave it to the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of godly learned men, whether leſs violence will not be done to the holy <hi>Text,</hi> by <hi>rendring it</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and expreſly, though in a <hi>phraſe more harſh</hi> to our Engliſh ears; then to <hi>impoſe our own ſenſe upon it,</hi> though in a <hi>phraſe and manner of ſpeech</hi> to us more familiar and better known. For albeit the expreſsion be uncouth and ſtrange, it will be the Preachers <hi>duty, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and comfort,</hi> to explain it unto the people, together with the <hi>ſpiritual meaning of it:</hi> How elſe can he be ſaid to teach them? For many of the people are, (at leaſt in their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,) ſo skilful in the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Scripture, that they diſdain to be further taught: So that one ſaid, (I ſay not how wiſely) that <hi>he would not go croſs the way, to hear what he knew not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</hi> Is it ſaid in vain, <hi>They ſhall ſeek the
<pb facs="tcp:65717:21"/>Law at the mouth of the Prieſt? Malach.</hi> 2.7. Therefore it is ſaid of the <hi>Levites;</hi> That they read in the Book of the Law of God, <hi>and gave the ſenſe, Nehem.</hi> 8.8. Whence it appears, that the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Scriptures, and much more the <hi>ſpiritual meaning</hi> of it, was obſcure even to the Jews themſelves, eſpecially after they bad <hi>been in Babylon.</hi> And may we not think, that the <hi>Letter of the Scripture</hi> muſt be yet obſcure to the Chriſtian Church, which, in <hi>S. Peters</hi> dayes, was in <hi>Babylon?</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.13. <hi>And is it yet come out of Babylon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When now I had ſometime proceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this <hi>method,</hi> and digeſted the more material miſtakes of the Tranſlation, into <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of plain weekly Sermons,</hi> (both becauſe <hi>I</hi> wanted other time properly to be beſtowed upon that Subject, as alſo that the <hi>Amendment of the Tranſlation,</hi> might appear not <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> but <hi>neceſſary</hi>) and had applyed the ſeveral <hi>

<pb facs="tcp:65717:21"/>the <hi>Hagiographa</hi> more then the <hi>Hiſtorical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> more then the <hi>Hagio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapha,</hi> and the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> moſt of all; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the <hi>New</hi> more then the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Conſidering alſo, that the Work would be very long, if I ſhould proceed thorowout the whole Scripture according to the ſame large meaſure of Application. Laſtly, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the infirmities of old age already upon me; and that <hi>Ars longa, vita brevis,</hi> the <hi>buſineſs is long, and life but ſhort; I</hi> thought meet in mine Eſſayes, to take notice of the miſ-tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other Scriptures as well as theſe of the Pentateuch obſerved in this Volume. And therefore although at firſt <hi>I</hi> put all Scriptures quoted promiſcuouſly either in the <hi>Margent,</hi> as in the <hi>beginning;</hi> or, (becauſe that was more troubleſome to the Compoſiter) in the <hi>Context;</hi> afterward I placed all ſuch Scriptures cited in the <hi>Margent,</hi> againſt the tranſlation of which, I conceived, there lay any juſt exception.</p>
            <p>For the diſcovery of theſe miſ-tranſlations I have uſed the help of diverſe of my friends, eſpecially Dr. <hi>Thomas Drayton,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Parker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Richard Hunt:</hi> who, beſide that, hath alſo taken great pains in making a <hi>Table of the Sermons</hi> contained in this Book; alſo an <hi>Index of ſuch Scriptures</hi> as either <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely,</hi> or <hi>occaſionally</hi> are opened in it; and alſo

            <p>The Lord, in mercy, be pleaſed to give his bleſsing unto theſe my weak <hi>Eſſayes and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi> that they may <hi>tend,</hi> as they are <hi>intended,</hi> unto his honour and glory, in the <hi>illuſtration</hi> of his ſerviceable Word, and the edifying of his people in their holy <hi>fear, faith,</hi> and <hi>love!</hi>

            <p>That this Tranſlation may yet appear the more fit, we may take notice that ſome of the beſt Philoſophers have compared the Fire and Air, to the Shell and White, the Water and Earth to the yolk of an Egge; upon which the Spirit of God here is ſaid to ſit and move it ſelf.

               </note> that God wrought alſo upon the ſeventh day; for to finiſh a work is to work. And if God finiſhed his work on the ſeventh day, then he did not reſt the whole ſeventh day: and ſo it ſhould be ſaid, that God reſted a part of the ſeventh day. For the avoiding of this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the LXX plainly corrupted the Text, and inſtead of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65717:25"/>ſeventh day, put the ſixth, and read the words thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God finiſhed his works on the ſixth day. This ſeems to have been their conſtant reading: For <hi>Hierom</hi> ſo read it in his time; and it is ſo and no otherwiſe extant at this day. According to the Letter, this Knot may be looſed, by ſaying, that the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> uſed <hi>Geneſis</hi> 2.2. which we render, ended, <hi>Perfecit,</hi> in the Preter tenſe, may be as well turn'd into the Preterpluperfect tenſe, <hi>Perfecerat,</hi> He had ended; becauſe there is but one Preter tenſe in the Hebrew, which is put for all the parts of time paſt.</p>
            <p>Howbeit Gods reſting after the Creation, is not literally only to be underſtood, but alſo ſpiritually. God reſted in his Son, through whom he made all things. And ſo we may read the words as now we do, in our laſt Tranſlation without that criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſtinction of Tenſes. God finiſhed his work on the ſeventh day; that is, on and in his Son by whom he made the Worlds. He is the true Sabbath. Gods well-beloved Son, <hi>in whom he is well pleaſed, Matth.</hi> 3.17. and 17.5. of whom the Father ſaith, <hi>Eſay</hi> 42.1. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

As for Gods ceſſation or privative Reſt after the Creation, our Lord Jeſus denies it: For when he had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an impotent man, who had been ſick thirty eight years, to carry his bed on the Sabbath-day, <hi>John</hi> 5.5.—16. He ſaith to the Jewes Verſe 17. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work, viz.</hi> works of righteouſneſſe, which he hath alwayes wrought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning, and ſhall alwayes work without end. He reſted on the Sabbath from making new kindes of creatures: But he ceaſeth not from his preſervation, government and ordering of thoſe creatures, which he hath made. The Carpenter leaves the Houſe, and the Shipwright the veſſel, which he hath built; and it is all one to him, whether it ſink or ſwim. But the great <gap reason="foreign">

Thus alſo the <hi>French</hi> Bible, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> as alſo <hi>Luthers</hi> tranſlation and the <hi>Low Dutch.</hi> Yea, all our Old Engliſh tranſlations. That which, I beleeve, moved the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators to caſt the true verſion into the Margent, and make the words a permiſſion, not a command, was their humane conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a ſeeming impoſſibility, that the Man ſhould eat of all the Trees in the Garden. They ſeem not to have remembred, that in Parables and Allegories many things are improper in the figure, which yet are made good and proper in the truth and thing figured and ſignified. To eat of a Tree, is not proper, but of the fruit of it: Howbeit to eat, partake of, and enjoy Chriſt who is the Tree of Life, yea, the Life it ſelf, its proper.

               </gap>, word for word, of the wood of Life. Or, if it ſignifie a Tree, rather a dry Tree then a green: which is not an Hebraiſm, but an Helleniſm. For whereas the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies wood and a tree, hence the word <gap reason="foreign">

That's the wood that makes the bitter waters ſweet, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. And <hi>Bleſſed is the wood, by which righteouſneſſe cometh, Wiſd.</hi> 14.7.</p>
            <p>Surely the true trees of the Garden, whereof the Man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to eat, and that of all of them, are the Plants of our heavenly Fathers planting, every grace, every vertue, all the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering,

It followes, that in the midſt of the ſtreet, and of either ſide of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe fruits muſt be exceeding plenteous, there muſt be Gods plenty of them.

And peace like a river, <hi>Eſay</hi> 66.12. And joy unſpeakable, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. For the end to which the fruits of the tree of life ſerve unto, require abundance of fruit, ſo much as may ſatisfie all Nations.

            <p>And as the fruit muſt be plenteous, ſo muſt the leaves, the outward profeſſion and practiſe: They are to heal the Nations, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.2. to heal the diſeaſed. So the Sun is not only the cauſe of life, but of medicin alſo. Therefore the Poets made <hi>Apollo</hi> the Sun, the Author of both.

And of this forbidden fruit ſhe her ſelf did eat, and gave her husband alſo to eat of it. And ſo fell away from the light and life and wiſdom and will of God to her own vain opinion, earthly wiſdom and will of the fleſh. This is that we call the fall of man, whereby the life is mingled with the death, good with evil, light with darkneſſe, truth with errour. This is the Mother ſin and Nurſe of all other.

               <p>For whereas in reading of the Old Teſtament, <hi>Moſes</hi> hath a vail upon his face, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>And not as Moſes which put a Vail over his face, that the children of Iſrael could not stedfaſtly look to the end of that which is aboliſhed.</hi> In reading the three firſt Chapters of <hi>Geneſis, Moſes</hi> is double vailed: And therefore thoſe three with the book of <hi>Canticles</hi> and ſome other Scriptures were by the wiſe men of the Jews prohibited to be read by Novices, leſt they might make ill conſtructions of them, as I ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in part.</p>
               <p>This was needful to be premiſed, becauſe the Text propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is a part of the third Chapter, and hath in it more difficulty then appears at the firſt reading of the words.

From which I ſhall not now longer detaine your thoughts, foreſeeing an occaſion that I may have to open the former part of this ſentence. Come we therfore more preciſely to the words of my text. Here is a fuid between two great families, and the effect of that fuid.</p>
               <p>The fuid is between the Serpent and the woman; which is Gods own doing: he ſaith, I will put enmity between thee and the woman.</p>
               <p>This is a laſting fuid, which ends not with the parties between whom it is firſt put, but is continued unto the poſterities. I will put enmitie between thee and the woman and between thy ſeed and ket ſeed.</p>
               <p>This fuid is not ſmothered as enmity may long be, but this fuid breakes out into open and irreconcileable hoſtility to the wounding, bruiſing, breaking one the other; all which will appeare in the handling of theſe Axioms.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Lord ſaith, he will put enmity between the ſerpent and the woman,</item>
                  <item>2. That he will put enmity between the ſeed of the Serpent and the ſeed of the woman.</item>
                  <item>3. That the ſeed of the woman ſhall breake the Serpents head.</item>

               <p>But 2. what is the woman? 1. what is ſhe not? ſurely not <hi>Eve</hi> alone: for then <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould not here be included, but left out. No nor can it be underſtood of woman-kinde alone; for then that ſex alone ſhould hate the Serpent, and not men alſo. Nor is it to be underſtood of the B. Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> alone: for then this promiſe ſhould ſtand at too great a diſtance from the firſt mercy here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the whole race of the fallen man; and ſhould be pent up in too narrow a ſcantling, yea this great inconveniencie would follow, that the Serpent ſhould reign from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> yea from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſt in the fleſh, without oppoſition, or at leaſt without ſubduing and overcoming. 2. what then is the woman?</p>
               <p>Surely as the Serpent is not literally here to be underſtood but Myſtically alſo, as I have ſhown; ſo is this woman ſome myſticall thing in both our firſt parents, and in all fallen men and women, or thoſe that might or may fall. This woman is ſomething that is taken out of the ſpirit of man, and is made an help unto him. And it is no other than his mind, underſtanding, thoughts and memory, through which he may ſtand or fall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.21. <hi>For the inviſible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly ſeen, &amp;c. They knew the eternal power and God-head</hi> which required of them a ſutable glorifying of God, <hi>but they became Vain in their imaginations and their fooliſh heart was darkned; Epheſ.</hi> 4.17.18. The Gentiles <hi>walked in the Vanitie of their mind and had their underſtanding darkned and ſo became alinated from the life of God.</hi> By thoſe the Gentiles fell, and by the ſame the <hi>Jewes</hi> fell alſo. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.23, 24. <hi>They walked in the counſell and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own heart.</hi> Thus yee read the minds or thoughts compared to <hi>Eve:</hi> 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> Chap. 11.3 <hi>I feare leaſt by any meanes as the Serpent beguiled Eve through his ſublilty ſo</hi>

               <p>The enmity is put between the Serpent and the woman, and between their ſeeds: and therefore I ſhall here ſpeak generally of it in this firſt point, and more particularly in the ſecond. Here then we may underſtand generally by enmity ſome what that diſſoders, and raveles that amity and friendſhip which was knit and contracted between the woman and the Serpent by reaſon of the fall. How be it we are not here to underſtand, that God puts any enmity reciprocally between both the woman and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. For ſurely he puts no enmity at all into the Serpent or his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65717:29"/>ſeed againſt the woman or her godly ſeed. That enmity which Satan hath againſt the woman and her godly ſeed, it is aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient, and needs no addition or increaſe, but is his own purchaſe which he hath made by his fall from God. The woman therefore is here to be underſtood as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ubiect of his enmity which, God ſaith, he will put into her which ſhall be exerciſed upon the Serpent and the Serpents ſeed, as the proper objects of it.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why the Lord puts enmity between the Serpent and the woman, appeares from the precedent act and depravation of Satan which the Lord here mainly intends to demoliſh and deſtroy; and therefore it is but reaſon that the remedy ſhould be applyed to the malady; wherefore as Satan begun his deſtructive ſeducing and deceit in the mind and underſtanding, as I have ſhewn, ſo in reaſon the Lord muſt begin his work of reparation and renewing there; as we find he does <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17.18. where the Apoſtle prayes <hi>that God would give them the Spirit of wiſdom and revelation for the acknowledgment of him, the eyes of their underſtanding being inlightned that they may know, &amp;c. Col.</hi> 1.9.18. The Apoſtle prayes that <hi>they might be filled with the knowledge of his will: &amp;c.</hi> So he prayes for <hi>Timothy, Conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give thee underſtanding in all things!</hi> 2 <hi>Tim Chap.</hi> 2. verſ. 7. Beſides; thoughts and counſells are the begining of every affection, word, and work: and therefore as when theſe are corrupted, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is layd for corrupting all the reſt: ſo when theſe are duely informed, a ſutable reparation will follow of all the reſt. Now becauſe we by the fall, <hi>are not able to thinke any thing that good is of our ſelves as of our ſelves,</hi> the wiſe and good God Vouchſafes a ſufficiency to thinke and doe. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. verſ. 5. not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, <hi>but our ſufficiencie is of God.</hi>

This heel the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent obſerves and bruiſes. In the neceſſities of the body, the ſoul muſt needs ſend forth the natural deſires for ſupply of them. Such are the deſires of earing and drinking. Theſe, and ſuch as theſe, are the heel of the inward man; which the Serpent obſerves. He obſerved theſe in our Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.3. He had faſted forty dayes; all that time ye hear not of the Tempter: but when he hungred, Verſe 2. then the Tempter came unto him. This the Apoſtle was aware of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Give your ſelves to faſting and prayer, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinencie.</hi> It is lawful to have a care and to provide for the ſupply of meat, and drink and raiment, &amp;c. yet this very care endangers us <hi>to fall into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and a ſnare,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9.

In regard of the Womans godly ſeed, that it might be continually exerciſed and be watchful. <hi>Virtus languet ſine adverſario.</hi> And <hi>therefore your adverſary the Devil goes about, &amp;c.</hi> 2. In regard of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, his innate Subtilty and malice. Who, ſince he is fallen from all lawfull power of commanding and compelling, <hi>Eſay</hi> 14. he now acts by craft and cunning, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. by deviſes and wiles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.11. <hi>The wiles of the Devill,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. And therefore he ſetts upon the weakeſt, <hi>He beguiled Eve through his ſubtiltie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This diſcovers what they are, whoſe ſeed and whoſe children, who reproach the ſteps, the converſation of Gods Saints. It is the Serpents work, <hi>To bruiſe and tread upon the heel,</hi> and his children, <hi>Serpents</hi> like himſelfe, as our Saviour calls them <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. who reproach the wayes of Chriſt, and his people, who ſlander and reproach <hi>the foot-ſteps of Gods annointed, Pſal.</hi> 89.51. who caſt aſperſions upon the pure religion and undefiled. I doubt not but there is a religion that is accounted pure, yet is defiled. <hi>A generation pure in their own eyes, yet are not cleanſed from their dung, Prov.</hi> 30.12. Yet there is a religion, that is pure, yet is accounted defiled, by the Serpent and his ſeed, who caſts aſperſions upon it without deſert, as a man may receive a daſh in his journey.</p>
               <p>Thus the Phariſees of old, whom our Lord calls the Children of the Devill, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. dealt with our Lord, bringing all falſe teſtimonies againſt him. And as they dealt with him, they have dealt and yet deal with his followers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. They declare evidently whoſe ſeed they are.</p>
               <p>This diſcovers the nature of the Serpent, he is a ſlanderer, he is a deceiver, he is a Supplanter.</p>

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65717:35"/>that is due unto him, when he has finiſhed his courſe. The Serpent <hi>In malis ſeparat finem à mediis,</hi> in good things ſeparates the end from the meanes: It was his firſt plot upon our firſt parents. Whereas the Lord had ſaid, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> he Subtilly perſwades them, that, though they eat of that Tree, yet they ſhould not die, and ſo ſeparates the end from the meanes. <hi>In bonis ſeparat media à fine,</hi> in good things he ſeparates the meanes from the end. Theſe meanes which the Lord hath ordained as neceſſary for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the everlaſting life, the Serpent perſwades men that the everlaſting life may be obtained without them. Our Lord ſaith by the Apoſtle, If we die with him, we believe that we ſhall live with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12. Nay, ſaith the Serpent, <hi>Only beleive and thou ſhalt live.</hi> He perſwades us that we need not die with Chriſt. By this meanes, He perſwades men, that, though they continue in their ſinnes, and uncleanneſſes, yet they ſhall obtain the everlaſting life. Thus by his falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, he had perſwaded the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that they muſt be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and keep the law, and that faith working by love was to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The holy Apoſtle, not ignorant of his devices, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. he tells them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2.—8. <hi>If they be circumciſed,</hi> Chriſt ſhall profit them nothing—that neither circumciſion availes any thing nor uncircumciſion, but faith that worketh by love, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> Look to our footing. Whereas the Scripture tells us eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, that the holy Citie is reſerved for thoſe who are holy and righteous, and obey the truth, <hi>Eſay,</hi> 26.12. and that he who <hi>Believes not, or obeyes not the Son</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) ſhall not ſee life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.36. And <hi>S. John</hi> having deſcribed the holy Citie, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. ver. 27. he tells us who ſhall bee excluded from thence, and ſhall not enter into it. Whereas our Saviour tells us what the things are that defile a man, <hi>Math.</hi> 15.19.20. Wheras the Scripture tells us all this; and many thereupon have believed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, through the power of the holy Spirit, to purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all theſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. The Serpent fearing leſt all men ſhould ſo do, he layes wait at the heel. He perſwades too many that this is <hi>Supervacaneum opus,</hi> a needleſs buſineſs; <hi>That Chriſt has long ſince wrought the purging of our ſins; that its impoſſible to be purged from them; that there is a</hi> Purgatory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after that will cleanſe us, which indeed muſt needs follow if their former aſſertion were true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meanes.</hi> Keep in the way.

That which will make me fear, is 1. Not povertie: The Judge is not corrupted with gifts. It is, 2. Not a low condition and ſtate of life. God is no reſpecter of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. It is 3. Not the malice either of Advocates or witneſſes. The Judge with whom we have to do, knowes the hearts of all men. It is 4. Not the power of adverſaries; The Judge fears no man.

               <p>ANd the Lord God ſaid, Behold <hi>the man is become</hi> as one of us knowing good and evill.] Moſt men commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe words Ironically, The man is become as one of Us: as upbrayding unto man, Satans lying Speech, ver. 5. Ye ſhall be as Gods knowing good and Evill. So Vatablus, Piſcator, Diodate, The Gloſſe of the French Bible, and others. But whether it be ſafe to attribute unto the moſt gratious and mercifull God ſo tart an ironie, I leave it to the conſideration of Godly men.</p>
               <p>Surely ſuch a kind of Mockery might ſeem to ſavour of an <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as if the good God rejoyced at the miſerable mans calamity; who yet fell thereinto not of himſelf, not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply out of pride or reflexion upon himſelfe and his own excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65717:36"/>as the Angels are ſaid to have fallen; and therefore God laid not hold on them:<note place="margin">Hebr. 2.26.</note> but man fell not without a Tempter but was overreached by the crafty &amp; falſe perſwaſion of the Serpent, more ſubtil then any beaſt of the field; by which ſubtilty he beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. And therefore the mercifull God pitied the deceived man: promiſed him victory over the Tempter, ver. 15. confirmed his bleſſing to the woman, ver. 20. That ſhe ſhould be the Mother of all thoſe who live the naturall life, and of all thoſe alſo who live the Spiritual life, yea, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt himſelfe; He clothed them with skins of dead beaſts figuring mortification and conformity unto Chriſts death; whoſe innocent life was ſlain in Adam;<note place="margin">Revel. 13.8.</note> (Then began the Lambe to be ſlain from the foundation of the world.)

               <p>Now is it probable, that the good God ſhould ſour all this his love and mercy with deriſion and mockery? How otherwiſe then ſhall we underſtand theſe words? Thus, The Lord God ſayd, Behold the man <gap reason="foreign">

But hereby the Lord implies a racite diſparity to that eſtate wherein the man now is, knowing the good, but not loving it; knowing the evill, but not hating it; at the beſt, in that condition which is deſcribed by the Poet.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.22.</note> to undeceive us, tells us of two births, which have their proportionable lives. And the firſt of theſe, the earthly, in every man muſt precede the heavenly which is the ſecond; <hi>Hagar</hi> muſt conceive before <hi>Sarah; Iſmael</hi> muſt be born before <hi>Iſaac;</hi> The children of the bond-woman muſt be brought forth before the children of the free-woman, where theſe two births are not known, nor the order of them, dangerous miſtakes ariſe from ſelf-love proper to the firſt birth. And becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaking of himſelf, and others with him who had attained unto the ſecond birth, and lived the ſpiritual life, <hi>We,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as Iſaac was, are the children of the promiſe; we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free;</hi> Hereupon too many, out of an over-weening opinion of themſelves, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſelf-love, put themſelves into the number, becauſe this and other like Scriptures are fitted not to their conditions, but to their mouthes; whereas indeed it is much to be feared, they are yet children of the bond-woman. As at this day the wilde people who deſcend from <hi>Iſmael,</hi> call themſelves <hi>Saracens,</hi> as if they were the children of <hi>Sarah;</hi> whereas indeed they are <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maelites</hi> and <hi>Hagarens,</hi> the progeny of <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Hagar.</hi> Would God it were not ſo with many of us! For we have ſeen, that they of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea</hi> have been groſſely deceived in their own eſtates; And why may not we fear the like in our ſelves? It's a dangerous thing to erre in a matter of ſo great and neer concernment. That we ſhould think our ſelves born of the free-woman, and conſider not, that there is in us, by nature, a kind of wildneſs and looſeneſs, which we oftentimes miſtake for the true freedom. It is no ſhame to acknowledge this; For <hi>Zephar</hi> tells <hi>Job</hi> truly,<note place="margin">Job 11.12.</note> that this is the condition of all mankind. Ye have for that purpoſe in <hi>Job</hi> the deſcription of the wilde Aſs. Such was the eſtate of the firſt child born to <hi>Abraham</hi> of the bond-woman <hi>Hagar.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">and 39.5.—8.</note> As ſoon as ſhe had conceived, ſhe thought ſhe ſhould bring forth the ſeed of promiſe, as <hi>Eve</hi> alſo thought. But her ſon proved <gap reason="foreign">

And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65717:37"/>this is the deſire of many, who know no better.

And let us take heed, leſt, while we are yet in our fallen eſtate, we miſtake not our ſelves as our mother did, who thought ſhe had gotten the <hi>man the Lord,</hi> when indeed ſhe brought forth <hi>Cain,</hi> who, by corruption, <hi>was of the wicked one,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.12.</p>

And this kinde of ſervice they had learn'd no doubt of their Father out of the minde of God, according to <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 17.

Mark 16.16.</note> and their contraries are taken one for the other; as may appear by many Scriptures. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>S. Mark</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned;</hi> The antient Church of Chriſt hath left us the ſame conditions onely made up into <hi>Obedience and diſobedience;</hi> They that have <hi>done good</hi> ſhall go into life everlaſting; <hi>and they that have done evill,</hi> into everlaſting fire. This is the Catholike faith, which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Thus if <hi>Cain</hi> out of belief, <hi>do well</hi> the Lord ſaith, he ſhall be accepted. And what is it,</p>
               <p>Secondly, To be <hi>accepted?</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and ſhort expreſſion comprehending 1. Pardon of ſin; and ſo if thou do well, thou ſhalt have remiſſion and pardon of thy ſin. So Chal. Par. And the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is ſo uſed. 2. It notes elevation or lifting up, <hi>viz.</hi> of the face, as with boldneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; and ſo if thou <hi>do well,</hi> thou ſhalt lift up thy Countenance with boldneſs, which was fallen before for ſhame <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.6. the fruit of ſin, <hi>What fruit had ye of thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed, Rom.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It ſignifies receiving, <hi>viz.</hi> of what was deſired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; So <hi>Hierom</hi> renders the word <hi>Recipies,</hi> thou ſhalt <hi>receive.</hi> And ſo if thou <hi>do well,</hi> thou ſhalt be heard of God, <hi>Nonne ſi rectè feceris, litabis?</hi> So <hi>Caſtellio</hi> renders the word, if thou <hi>do well,</hi> thou ſhalt obtain acceptance, of thy ſacrifice, and a bleſſing, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.5.</p>
               <p>As for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which we render interrogatively, ſhalt thou not be accepted? It may as well be turned by way of poſitive aſſertion as an Adverb of affirming, <hi>certè,</hi> Surely, or truly thou ſhalt be accepted.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why, if <hi>Cain</hi> did well, he ſhould be pardoned his ſin, and ſhould lift up his face with Confidence, and ſhould be accepted, may be Conſidered from that naturall Connexion that is between doing good and receiving good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From that tacite Covenant between God and man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The good will of God toward man, even the ſinfull man. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>Even the Heathen have inbred in their hearts, this thought of God, that it is <hi>Dei proprium ſervare et benefacere,</hi> that is, it is Gods property to ſave from evill and do good. Since therefore it is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65717:39"/>alſo the end that God, and alſo his creatures aime at, to aſſimilate and render others like unto themſelves, this the Lord aimed at to promote in <hi>Cain,</hi> as indeed in all men an endeavour to do well, and do good, as alſo to eſchew evill. And thus the Lord acted according to his property endeavouring to preſerve <hi>Cain</hi> from doing evill, and to perſwade him to do good, and ſo to be like unto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That as ſin is a burden and that a great and heavy one, as <hi>Cain</hi> complaines, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. So the remiſſion and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the ſin, is the lifting up the burden of our ſin, and ſo eaſing us of it. As the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7. Interprets the word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquities are forgiven,</hi> or <hi>are lifted up, and removed,</hi> and ſo the ſinner eaſed. For as evill doers are threatned, as an inceſtuous perſon, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.17.19. <hi>He ſhall bear his iniquitie;</hi> So they that do well, the Lord <hi>beares their iniquitie, Eſay.</hi> 53.11. <hi>And takes away their ſinns from them, Rom.</hi> 11.26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Hence we learne, what procures acceptance even with God himſelf, what elſe but <hi>doing well?</hi> If thou <hi>do well ſhalt thou not be accepted, Pſal.</hi> 15. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 1.16.—20. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.1.—9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.6.7.8. If this be well conſidered, it will cauſe us to ſet a price and value upon <hi>well-doing</hi> and upon <hi>good works,</hi> which of late have been under valued and decryed under the names of <hi>Popery, Arminianiſme</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>This is alſo the meaning of the phraſe in the Text, lifting up, if thou do well: <hi>So Zophar</hi> truly tells <hi>Job.</hi> 11.13.4.5. and the ſame Counſel is given him by <hi>Eliphaz, Job.</hi> 22.23.—26. the ground of that boldneſs in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn, Act.</hi> 4.13.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is contrary to the Syntax: for <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſin</hi> is of the Feminine gender, whereas the Relatives are Maſculine. To this purpoſe ſounds the Gloſs of the French Bible.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is here of the Maſculine gender, not of the Feminine. For whereas words whoſe gender is doubtfull, are diſcovered of what gender they are, by the Verb, Adjective, Pronoune, or participle joyned with them, ſince therefore the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the undoubted Antecedent unto theſe Relatives, it's evident that here it's Maſculine, however elſewhere it may be Feminine: Beſide <hi>S. Hierom,</hi> one of the moſt learned of all the Fathers, in all the three Originall Tongues, he in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the place, affirms, that the word is Maſculine. Queſt: Heb. in <hi>Gen.</hi> And <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> lib. 15. <hi>de Civit. dei.</hi> Cap. 7. Shews plainly to what Antcedent the Relative referrs us; <hi>Tu dominaberis illius; Num quid fratris? Abſit! cujus igitur niſi peccati?</hi> Thou ſhalt rule; Over what? Over thy Brother? O no; over what then, but over Sin? Yea <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on the place judges it abſurd to refer the Maſculine Relative to any other Antecedent then unto <hi>ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> were here and elſewhere onely a Feminine, I appeal unto the learned in the Hebrew tongue, whether this kinde of <hi>Anomaly</hi> of joyning Maſculines and Feminines in Grammatical Conſtruction, be not uſuall in holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>But the beſt proof wherewith to convince the Tranſlatours, or who ever elſe ſhall herein defend them, is their own practice, and that in the very words immediatly before; where they make no ſcruple to joyn <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſin lieth or lying</hi> at the dore. Where if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be Feminine, certainly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is Maſculine. And here is the ſame reaſon of Syntax in the later Sentence which is in the former.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is evident out of the former words: For ſince the Lord promiſes reward for well doing; and threatens puniſhment for evill doing, in all reaſon and equity there muſt be a power in man to will the good, and nill the evill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another reaſon may be from the great wiſdom and goodnes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65717:41"/>of God, who albeit he permit ſin in the world for exerciſe and tryall of his own people; as he permitted ſome of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> to remain in the Land, yet he reſerves a power, and imparts a power unto man for the ſubduing of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. Hence it follows, that there is in man a free principle of well and evill doing, and that even in evill men, as in <hi>Cain</hi> here. This we finde in <hi>Saul</hi> making apologie to <hi>Samuel</hi> for his offering Sacrifice before he came, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. This acquaints us with that which we call free will, which is very much miſtaken by moſt men, For true freedom is a power to will and do what is good without any hindrance in him who wills and does it.

And being ſet free from all this bondage, the true libertie is the addicting ones whole ſelfe, underſtanding, reaſon, will, affections, actions, life unto God and his righteouſneſs. This freedom is wrought by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32.36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17.18. and 8.2.

Learn we hence, that ſome men are ſo hardned in their ſinful courſes, that though God himſelf preach unto them from Heaven, yet they will not be moved at it, but wilfully and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately perſiſt in them. The Lord himſelf had preached to <hi>Cain</hi> both the Law and the Goſpel, yet he remained in his hardneſs of heart, and his bloody purpoſe of killing his Brother; as appears by the ſequel of the ſtory.</p>
               <p>Beloved! I may here take up a ſad &amp; ſerious complaint and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation over our much preaching and hearing; and our little practice and obedience. They who conſider the former, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent preaching and much hearing, would judge us of this City, to be the beſt Chriſtians in the world. They who ſee the later, the lives and practices, and dealings in the world of many of us may judge rightly that they are the very worſt. And this brings a ſhame upon the profeſsion of Chriſtianity, and cauſes a neglect in many of reſorting to the Congregation, who obſerve that many place their religion in going to Church and hearing, and eſpecially ſuch or ſuch a <hi>precious man.</hi> For they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve alſo, that he goes to Church an envious perſon, and returns
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65717:42"/>from thence an envious perſon. He who comes into the Aſſembly a covetous man, he goes out as covetous as he came; he who comes in a Drunkard, goes out a Drunkard. He who reſorts to the Aſſembly a <hi>Cain</hi> rull of murderous thoughts and purpoſes, he goes away as arrant a <hi>Cain,</hi> as reſolved a murderer as he came.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, That as of old, men by reaſon of abuſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17. to 45. So many at this day forſake the aſſembling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together. They ſay of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> that being here in <hi>England,</hi> he came to none of our Churches, and being asked his reaſon, he ſaid, becauſe he obſerved that men came forth of the Church more proud then they went in. And the truth is, if men be not the better, they are the worſe, becauſe they flatter themſelves with a form of godlineſſe, and with that, which we object to others, the <hi>opus operatum;</hi> as if the very hearing Gods word made them the better men.</p>
               <p>Thus ye read of the Whore in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> that ſhe ſtrengthens her ſelf in her whoredoms by her form of godlineſs, <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.14.15.</p>

                  <hi>Reproof.</hi> Of thoſe to whom the Lord gives the ſoveraignty and rule over ſin, yet they proſtitute themſelves, and enſlave their ſoules under the bondage of ſin and iniquity.</p>
               <p>Hence we have a ground of Exhortation to maſter and rule over our ſin. When <hi>Abraham</hi> had given <hi>Hagar</hi> into the power of <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 16.6. ſhe afflicted her and brought her under. And wheras the Lord hath given iniquity into our power, let us ſubdue it. A Servant will not be corrected with words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.19. And therefore <hi>S. Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. I keep under my body, ſaith he, and bring it into ſubjection, &amp;c. The <hi>Romans</hi> when they wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged war with their Servants who rebelled againſt them, their Servants prevailed while their Maſters fought with them with their ſwords: thereby they did <hi>ipſo facto</hi> make the Servants Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Which their Maſters perceiving, brought Whips and Scourges with them into the field, and ſo ſubdued them. Words and reaſonings are ineffectual to ſubdue the earthly and ſenſuall concupiſcence, <hi>Venter non habet aures. Eve</hi> reaſoned with the Serpent, and was foiled at that weapon. Deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. Reſiſt the Devil. Tread him under foot. By Repentance and Faith the world is overcome, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. And <hi>Bleſſed be God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>But let every one take heed what, and how, and with whom he builds. For <hi>Cain</hi> and his builders have as fair pretences as may be.

And theſe pretend to build the City of God,<note place="margin">Ezra 4.2.</note> as the adverſaries of the Jewes did, and would build with them. And therefore it will neerely concern us to deſtinguiſh the two Cities, which, ſo different, ſo contrary families <hi>are building,</hi> the one of the love of God and their neighbour; which is <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> the <hi>City of David which is Love.</hi> The other oppoſit here unto is the City of the devill; which therefore muſt be <hi>Envy, Hatred, Malice and all uncharitableneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This City men begin to build and inhabit, when they depart from the other.

And as we conceive the Kings Image in his Coin not onely formally, abſtractly, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, the reſemblance and figure of the King, but alſo concretely and joyntly the money, the Silver or Gold, wherein it is imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Even ſo the image of God howſoever it be primarily in the ſoule, yet it may be ſaid alſo to be in the body, the ſeat of the ſoul; whoſe rectitude and ſtraitneſs proper to that alone of all the living creatures, repreſents that inward rectitude and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, wherein the man is made, and an argument of Majeſty and Soveraignty over all the Creatures; the ſtrength, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beauty, feature and comlineſs are anſwerable in ſome ſort to the like vertues in the image of God.

As alſo becauſe the ſoul works by the body conformably to the image of God; whence it is,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.13.</note> that the members of the body are inſtruments of righteouſneſs unto God. And hence it is, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.20.</note> that our bodies and Spirits are Gods. Yea, the image of God extends it ſelf ſo far, that all the outward creatures belonging unto man, may be ſaid in ſome ſort to appertain unto the image of God in man; not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Dei Veſtigium eſt in creaturis,</hi> ſaith the School, the footſtep and ſimilitude of God is in the creatures; but alſo becauſe God hath given unto man the outward creatures not as any part of his image, but to adorn his image in him. As Painters and Carvers ſet out their Images and Statues, by Pictures of diverſe creatures, which are not any parts, but ornaments of the Statues and Images, which they principally intend to make. Thus every creature hath Gods mark upon it, <hi>aut imaginem aut veſtigium,</hi> either Gods expreſſe image upon it, as the reaſonable creature, or ſome other impreſſion or ſimilitude of the Deity; which remembers us, and ſends us to the Author of it: As when we ſee among the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures any thing that's beautiful and fair, or ſtrong, or any other
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65717:51"/>way good, it minds us and cauſes our thoughts and meditations to aſcend unto that Eſſential beauty, ſtrength, or whatſoever other Excellency is to be found in God.</p>
               <p>In a word; Gods mark and footſtep in the Creature is in order unto Gods Image in man. Gods image in man is in order unto Gods image which is Chriſt. Gods image, which is Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.22, 23.</note> is in order unto God. This gradual order is excellently obſerved and ſet down by <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>When now the man had defaced that glorious image of his God, in himſelf, and diſturbed that excellent order of himſelf and all the Creatures unto God, The Lord ſent <gap reason="foreign">

For according to this Tranſlation, the Lord here ſeems to promiſe; that he will not again deal ſo ſeverely with mankind, becauſe the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth; and therefore ſo to curſe the ground for mans ſake; ſo to ſmite every living thing, would be to no purpoſe: Why? becauſe mankinde is incorrigible; the imagination of his heart is evil from his youth; and therefore to go about to mend the matter by blotting out the living creature, as if thereby the ſins of men could be blotted out, it would be as available, as if a man ſhould endeavour to draw water with a Net. So one of the Fathers reaſons from hence, whoſe name I ſpare. Another of them argues thus down-right: The Lord ſaith, I will not any more curſe the Earth for the works of men, becauſe the minde of man
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65717:51"/>is ſet upon miſchief from his youth; therefore I will not any more ſmite every living ſoul, as I have done. And leſt we ſhould think, that the Ancients onely were of this minde; moſt of the later Expoſitors are of the ſame judgement. The Gloſſe of the <hi>French Bible</hi> ſpeaks their opinion. For it ſets a Star in the Text, directing us to ſomewhat more remarkable in the Margent; which is this: <hi>He ſhews, what men muſt be until the end of the world, wherein all mankinde is condemned as wholly wicked and</hi> depraved. How then ought theſe words to be rendred? That we may underſtand this, we muſt look back at the former words. For if we conſider the former words, they will give light to theſe, Verſe 20. <hi>Noah</hi> builded an altar unto the Lord, and took of every clean beaſt, and of every clean foul, and offered burnt offerings upon the altar. And the Lord ſmelled a ſavour of reſt (ſo the Marg. according to the Hebrew) And the Lord ſaid in his heart, I will not &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe words preſent us with <hi>Noah's</hi> acts, and the effect of them. <hi>Noah's</hi> acts are building an Altar, and offering Sacrifice upon it. The effect, Gods acceptance intimated in <hi>the Savour of reſt:</hi> and his promiſe thereupon.</p>
               <p>Surely our God is not taken with outward Offerings or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. Theſe were onely figurative of Chriſts acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. <hi>Noah</hi> was a manifeſt type of Chriſt, whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured in his name, and in his works. 1. <hi>Hierom</hi> renders <hi>Noahs</hi> name (as from <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) by two words, <hi>Ceſſatio</hi> and <hi>Requies,</hi> Ceſſation and Reſt. 1. Ceſſation implies leaving off former labour. 2. Reſt, acquieſcence and complacency in good. Both which are anſwerable to the two parts of univerſall Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and the whole will of God; ceaſing from evill, and doing good; whereof we have frequent mention,<note place="margin">Eſay 1.16, 17 1 Pet. 3.</note> ceaſe to do evill, learn to do well, Eſchew evill, and do good.</p>
               <p>In both reſpects,<note place="margin">Pſal. 40.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Noah</hi> was a type of the Lord Jeſus, who was content to do Gods will. Yea, who was figured by <hi>David,</hi> that man who was to do all Gods wills,<note place="margin">Acts 13.22.</note> (the word is plurall) which wills are our ſanctification and ſeparation from all evill labour, and the curſe, and enſtating and quieting our ſoules in the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.

               </p>
               <p>Thus the Lord Jeſus the true <hi>Noah</hi> removes the curſe, being made a curſe for us. He procures alſo the Bleſſing; which alſo was figured by <hi>Noah.</hi> He procures the Bleſſing by two acts. 1. Preparatory which is <hi>Removens prohibens;</hi> 2. Direct; firſt, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory,<note place="margin">Acts 3.26.</note> whereby he prevents every believer; For God having
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65717:52"/>raiſed up his Son Jeſus hath ſent him to bleſs us and to turn every one of us away from our iniquities. This preparatory act is as it were a fitting and ſeaſoning of our veſſells; which done,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.13, 14. Tit. 3.6.</note> then followes his direct act, the filling of our veſſells being ſo fitted and prepared, with the Spirit of grace; which God ſheds on us abundantly through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour. And ſo <hi>bleſſeth us with every ſpiritual bleſſing in heavenly things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto we have conſidered <hi>Noah's</hi> Name, and found how ſhort he came of the full performance of what his father <hi>Lamech</hi> had boded of him; which yet was fully accompliſhed by the true Spiritual <hi>Noah,</hi> whoſe type he bare. Come we now to conſider the acts of <hi>Noah,</hi> which alſo were more completely done by the Spiritual <hi>Noah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As for <hi>Noah's</hi> acts, they were two. 1. Building an altar, and 2. Offering Burnt Offerings upon that Altar. The Altar prefigured Chriſt and his patience; who is that true Altar,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.19.</note> which Sanctifies all our gifts. And by whom we offer up unto God the Sacrifice of Praiſe. The Apoſtle applies this unto Chriſt;<note place="margin">Heb. 13.10.</note> and eſpecially to his propitiatorie Sacrifice. We have an Altar, ſaith he, whereof they have no right to eat, who ſerve the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle: For the bodies of thoſe beaſts, whoſe blood is brought into the Sanctuary, by the High Prieſt, for ſin, are burnt without the Camp. Wherefore Jeſus alſo, that he might ſanctify the people with his own blood, ſuffered without the Gate. 2. The Sacrifice, which <hi>Noah</hi> offered, yielded a ſweet Savour unto the Lord; ſo that he ſmelt a ſavour of reſt, wherein <hi>Noah's</hi> name is contained, as I ſhewed before. But can we think that God is delighted with the ſmell of burnt beaſts,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> as <hi>Lucian</hi> ſaith his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then gods were? Doubtleſs this Sacrifice of <hi>Noah</hi> ſignified the expiatory Sacrifice of Chriſt, who gave up himſelf an Oblation for us, and a Sacrifice to God for a ſmell of a ſweet Savour.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.2.</note> And this is that <hi>Savour of reſt,</hi> which the Lord here ſmelt.</p>
               <p>And by this Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Gal. 3, 13.</note> the true Spiritual <hi>Noah</hi> takes away the curſe, Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law being made a curſe for us; and gives the bleſſing, as hath been ſhewn. All this premiſed, let us conſider the following words here in queſtion, whereunto I have hitherto made a long but a neceſſary preamble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord ſmelt a ſweet ſavour of reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the Lord ſaid in his heart, I will not again curſe the ground any more; Or, word for word, The Lord ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his heart, or in his heart, or to his heart, that is, to the heart of <hi>Noah,</hi> to comfort him; for ſo to ſpeak to ones heart, is to comfort, as the Prophet varies the phraſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40.1, 2.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.14.</note> And thus the Ancients underſtand the Lord to direct his ſpeech to <hi>Noah.</hi> I will not adde to curſe the Earth any more for man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65717:53"/>the thought, frame, form, or ſhape of the heart of man <hi>was</hi> evil from his youth: and I will not adde any more to ſmite all living, as I have done.</p>
               <p>By all this, it appeareth; that thoſe words, [becauſe the thought of the heart of man <hi>was</hi> evil from his youth] are brought by the Lord, as a reaſon why he had curſed the earth and ſmitten all living. Nor is this any wreſting of the words at all; but the clear context. I put <hi>was</hi> inſtead of <hi>is.</hi> There is no Verb at all in the Hebrew, but one muſt be neceſſarily ſupplied; and ſuch as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refers to the time paſt then either to the preſent or future. Becauſe the words contain the Lords reaſon, why he dealt ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely with the old World? And leſt this ſeem <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and onely any private opinion, it's clear, that upon this very reaſon,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> the Lord reſolved to puniſh the old World with the flood; <hi>The Lord ſaw, that the wickedneſſe of man was great in the earth, and</hi> every imagination <hi>of the thoughts of his heart, was onely evil every day, &amp;c. And the Lord ſaid, I will blot out man whom I have created, from the face of the earth.</hi> And the ſame reaſon the Lord brings here, why he had blotted out the old World: And thus <hi>Tremellius</hi> underſtood the words, as appears by his pointing of them: &amp; thus <hi>Pagnin</hi> alſo and <hi>Caſtellio</hi> who puts the words in a Parentheſis, and expreſly refers them to the former as the reaſon why the Lord had ſo ſeverely puniſhed the old World. Yea, the Lord elſewhere ſo reaſons in <hi>Eſay.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 54.7.10</note> Let us now ſee what will follow if thoſe words be underſtood as a reaſon why the Lord will not any more puniſh the old World as he had done.</p>
               <p>They, who make thoſe words <hi>[the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth]</hi> a reaſon why the Lord will no more curſe the ground for mans ſake, nor ſmite any more every living thing as he had done; they who ſo reaſon, and underſtand the Lord here ſo to reaſon, they make the caſe of mankinde deſperate; and God leaving man in that caſe, without remedie of his miſery, and without hope of reformation by any puniſhment. Yea, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they obliquely deny the general judgement;<note place="margin">2 Pet 3.7.</note> when without doubt there ſhall be an univerſal perdition of all ungodly men; whereas here they ſeem to underſtand God to ſay, —<hi>Quod multis peccatur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6.5.</note> 
                  <hi>inultum eſt.</hi> Yea, they make that to be here an argument of Gods mercy, which before was the main motive of his wrath. So that ſtrange collections are made from hence. One of great fame and regard, a <hi>German</hi> Author whom I will not name, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes hence; our nature is <hi>Gantz und gar</hi> altogether uncapable of any good, and inclined to all evil. So that little notice is taken, That theſe words have reference unto the former, and are a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unto Gods former ſeverity. Nor do men regard the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here made by Chriſt figured in <hi>Noahs</hi> Sacrifice. Nor how the Lord does <hi>reſtituere in integrum?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 8.22.</note> begin the world again with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65717:53"/>mankinde, promiſing, that, while the Earth endureth, the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the year ſhall not be interrupted by an univerſal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Jer. 33.20.21. Gen. 9.1.—17</note> as they had been, whereby alſo the Lord confirmes his promiſe of grace by Chriſt. Nor is there any due reſpect had to the bleſſing of God upon <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, nor to that domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which God gives them over the Beaſts, figuring more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Beaſts in us; nor to thoſe ſeven Precepts given to the ſons of <hi>Noah,</hi> whereof the ſeventh is here firſt given, <hi>viz.</hi> prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of eating fleſh with the life and blood: and the other ſix ſuppoſed to be given before: which all Nations who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowſhip with the Jewes, muſt obſerve. Nor have they regard to Gods covenant with <hi>Noah</hi> and his houſe and every living ſoul for ever, and that ratified by Gods oath;<note place="margin">Eſay 54.9, 10</note> and a viſible ſigne.</p>
               <p>All which, if duly conſidered, will appear to be as great grace as was vouchſafed to man, if not greater than that given him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall, which was divine bleſſing,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26, 27.</note> the image of God in righteouſneſs and holineſs; and the ſoveraignty over the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Yea,<note place="margin">Gen. 9.6. Gen. 5.1, 2.</note> as great or greater than was vouchſafed unto man in his renovation. And therefore ſuch grace and favour laid a proportionable Obligation upon <hi>Noah</hi> and all mankinde of their obedience. Now I beſeech the Chriſtian Reader well to heed and conſider, of what conſequence it is, whether we refer thoſe words to the former as a reaſon why the Lord brought in the floud upon the world of the ungodly, and ſo read them thus. I will not again curſe the ground any more for mans ſake, becauſe the imagination of mans heart <hi>was</hi> evill from his youth, &amp;c. Or whether we underſtand thoſe words as an inference from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, thus, I will not again curſe the ground any more for mans ſake; for the imagination of mans heart is evill from his youth, &amp;c. If we read them the former way and conſider the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made, and the Promiſes of God, they bring with them an argument of good hope, and erect the ſoul and raiſe it up unto an obedient walking with God. If we read them the later way, they imply, that God, not with ſtanding all meanes uſed, had no hope of bringing mankinde to any good; and conſequently the man muſt remit and leave off all endeavour of doing well, and ſuffer his ſoul to languiſh and ſinck into an utter deſpondency and deſperation. For how can man have any hope of good, when God himſelf deſpaires? The Lord give us grace to diſcern of things that differ!</p>

                     <item>1. What is it properly to bleſs, and to be bleſſed?</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Bleſſing properly ſignifies increaſe,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.21. and 9.1.</note> whether in temporall things; <hi>God bleſſed them, ſaying, increaſe and multiply.</hi> And where we read, <hi>God bleſſed Noah and</hi> his ſones, <hi>Caſtellio</hi> turns the word, <hi>Foecunditatem dedit, He gave them fruitfullneſs, ſaying, increaſe and multiply,</hi> &amp;c. So in ſpiritual things alſo, <hi>God hath bleſſed us with every ſpirituall bleſſing in heavenly things in Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Shem</hi> was bleſſed with temporall and ſpirituall bleſſings, and famous for them, eſpecially, for his piety and reverence towards his Father; and that the Lord prevented him with his grace that he would not ſee,<note place="margin">Acts 3.26.</note> much leſſe, deride and ſcoff at his Fathers nakedneſs. It is no ſmall bleſſing to be turned from iniquity, as <hi>Shem</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Why did <hi>Noah</hi> bleſs <hi>Shem</hi> from the Lord his God?<note place="margin">Pſal. 144.15. Heb. 11.16.</note> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeems to be taken from the covenant. <hi>They deſire a better Country, that is an heavenly; wherefore God is not, aſhamd to be called their God.</hi> More eſpecially the bleſſing is here given to <hi>Shem</hi> for his honouring of his Father, according to that of the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;<note place="margin">Eccluſ. 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother both in word and deed, that a bleſſing may come upon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why is <hi>Shem</hi> bleſſed before <hi>Japhet</hi> the elder Brother, the more eſpeciall reaſon is thought to be, his greater forwardneſs to cover his fathers nakedneſs, So that here he ſeems for that cauſe to have precedency in the bleſſing. I ſhall adde another reaſon in the proper place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. It is not Gods method in bleſſing, to follow the order of nature. <hi>Abraham</hi> is preferred before <hi>Haran</hi> his elder Brother. <hi>Iſmael</hi> was the firſt born;<note place="margin">Gen. 11.26. and 48.20.</note> yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> obtained the bleſſing. So did <hi>Iacob</hi> though <hi>Eſau</hi> were the elder Brother. And <hi>Ephraim</hi> though the yonger is preferred by <hi>Iacob</hi> and bleſſed before <hi>Manaſſes. God ſees not as man ſees;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 21.3.</note> 
                  <hi>nor are his wayes as mans waies.</hi> The elder Brother among men is moſt eſteemed by his parents, according to which rule,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.6.—10:</note> 
                  <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> proceeded, when he preferred <hi>Jehoram.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Eliab, Abinadab, &amp;c.</hi> are better eſteemed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by <hi>Jeſſe</hi> and <hi>Samuel.</hi> But ſome yonger one proves often times the better man, who is leaſt thought of, as <hi>Abraham, as Shem, as Joſeph, and David.</hi> If we enquire into a more hidden reaſon of this, we may as well finde it in our ſelves as without us in the world: that which is born of God in us and which he moſt prizes is the ſecond birth; <hi>the firſt man is of the earth, earthy; the ſecond is the Lord from heaven.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. It is no ſmall bleſſing to be preſerved and kept from doing evill.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25 32 Marth. 1.21. 2 Cor. 13.7. 2 Tim. 4.18 Jam. 1 17.

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. Obſerve the goodneſs of God toward children obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their parents. All we certeinly know, that <hi>Shem</hi> did,<note place="margin">Gen. 9.22, 23</note> is honouring of his father; Yet he is for that, bleſſed of God, and ſo bleſſed, that of his line deſcended <hi>Heber, Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob.</hi> And for this, the wiſe man tells us, he is parallel'd with <hi>Sheth,</hi> who in his time, ſaith <hi>Theodoret,</hi> was called a God upon earth, <hi>Deificatus homo,</hi> as the Antients ſpeak,<note place="margin">Eccluſ. 49.16 and 3. <hi>per tot.</hi> Ier. 35. Epheſ. 6.2.</note> 
                  <hi>and obtained great honour, among men.</hi> The ſame Wiſeman records many bleſſings unto them who honour their parents. What's the reaſon that <hi>Philo</hi> reckons the fift Commandement in the firſt Table? It is a great Commandement, and the firſt with promiſe. A notable Encouragement unto children to honour their parents.</p>

When the Patriarch went about to bleſs his ſon <hi>Shem,</hi> he breaks out into the bleſsing of the Lord God of <hi>Shem:</hi> was this to bleſſe <hi>Shem?</hi> Truly then was <hi>Shem</hi> moſt bleſſed, when God was bleſſed and owned and acknowledged as the only Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all his bleſsing.<note place="margin">Gen. 28.14, 15, 16. 1 Sam. 25.32, 39. 1 King. 8.14, 15. Gal. 1.24. 1 Cor. 15.10.</note> We ſhall finde this to be the practiſe of Gods Saints. After all the bleſsings which the Lord had hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on <hi>Jacob, Jacob</hi> looks not on the bleſsings, much leſſe upon himſelf, he looks upon the Lord the Author of them all. So did <hi>David.</hi> So <hi>Solomon</hi> is ſaid to have bleſſed the Congregation when he bleſſed God. <hi>They glorified,</hi> not me, ſaith <hi>S. Paul,</hi> but <hi>God in me; and I laboured, &amp;c. yet not I, but the grace of God with me.</hi> And truly what good ſoever befals the Saints of God, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it not to any worth in themſelves, but unto God, or ſome gift of God imparted unto them. The faithful ſervant ſaith not,<note place="margin">Luke 19.16.</note> as we are wont to do, <hi>I have gained,</hi> but <hi>thy pound hath gained ten pounds;</hi> and the other, <hi>thy pound hath gained five pounds.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.8.</note> He ſaith not, <hi>I have done this or that.</hi> It was his obedience of faith that gained it, <hi>and that is the gift of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Iohn 5.4.</note> So <hi>thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi> And when ever we have gained any conqueſt over any luſt, it is not any power of nature; but we muſt ſay,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.57.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed be God that gives us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When <hi>Zachariah,</hi> the father of <hi>John</hi> had been now long dumb, he broke ſilence, not with exultation or expreſsion of joy for the great bleſsing of God upon himſelf, or upon Iſrael.<note place="margin">Luke 1.68.</note> His firſt words are the praiſe of God: <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael;</hi> after that large bleſsing of God powred upon the Church,<note place="margin">Eſay 44.4.5</note> 
                  <hi>I will powre my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſsing upon thine off-ſpring, &amp;c.</hi> How great are thoſe who ſhall be thought worthy of the bleſſed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65717:61"/>Spirit? it followes, <hi>one ſhall ſay, I am the Lords, &amp;c.</hi> The Church appropriates nothing to it ſelf, but gives all the glory unto God. There is no loſs in this faithful and juſt dealing with God, <hi>Euge bone ſerve, Thou haſt been faithful in a little, be thou ruler over ten Cities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O that we all underſtood this aright, and accordingly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, to own the Lord in his gifts unto men! there would not be ſuch robbing God of his honour, ſuch aſſuming that glory to our ſelves,<note place="margin">John 5.44. Acts 8.9, 10. Mat. 9.8.</note> which is proper unto God, there would not be ſuch receiving of praiſe one of another, there would not be ſuch idolizing of men as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did to their <hi>Simon Magus. Quantò rectius hi?</hi> O how much better did they, who glorified God, who had given ſuch power unto men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. Obſerve the power of faith; out of it <hi>Noah</hi> gives inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances to his children;<note place="margin">Gen. 27.28, 29, 37.</note> out of it, <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſes his ſons, and of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> he ſaith,<note place="margin">Gen. 48.22. with 33.18.</note> 
                  <hi>And he ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> and as if it were done already, <hi>I have ſatisfied him with corn and wine.</hi> So <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſed his ſons, <hi>Joſeph</hi> eſpecially. I have given to thee one portion, which cannot be underſtood of that field which he bought: Therefore his faith is praiſed,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.21.</note> 
                  <hi>I took it ſaith he, by my Sword and bow;</hi> that is, by prayer and ſupplication ſaith the Chal. Par.</p>
               <p>Here we muſt note a difference of Bleſſing; When the Lord God bleſſeth <hi>Shem</hi> and the <hi>Shemites,</hi> he beſtowes good things upon them.<note place="margin">Deut. 28.2. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Dei benedicere eſt benefacere;</hi> when <hi>Shem</hi> bleſſeth God, he returnes humble thanks and prayſes,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.26, 27. with Luke 22.19: Pſal. 68, 19. Epheſ. 1.3. Pſal. 63.4: 1 Pet. 2.9.</note> for Gods bleſſings received. As bleſſing ſignifies thanksgiving, ſo likewiſe prayſing. Howbeit this bleſſing, prayſing and thanksgiving is not a bare outward expreſſion of thankfulneſs in words, but a manifeſtation of it in the life. A declaration of the divine vertues in thoſe who ſo bleſſe him.</p>
               <p>This is comfort to the people of God, the true <hi>Shemites,</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the true <hi>Shem,</hi> in theſe and all perillous times; The Lord God is their God, and he in covenant with them and bleſſes them; and they have alwayes that for which they may bleſſe their God, as <hi>Job</hi> on the Dunghill, <hi>the Lord not onely hath given, but hath taken what he hath given, Bleſſed be the name of Shem, the true Shem, the name of the Lord,</hi> what's the reaſon? The Lord God of <hi>Shem,</hi> yea the true <hi>Shem,</hi> is with them, bearing the evill with them,<note place="margin">Gen. 31.3. with 32.10. Pſal. 50.15.</note> and doing them good.

Thus of <hi>Hagar</hi> the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.1. that ſhe was an hand-maid an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> the ſervant of <hi>Sarai,</hi> a bond-maid of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of <hi>Hams</hi> poſterity as <hi>Canaan</hi> was; but ſhe was a figure of the Law, that gendreth unto bondage. Alſo it's ſaid verſ. 12. that <hi>Jſmael</hi> was a man like a wild Aſſe: this was fulfilled in part in himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.22. but much more in his poſteritie, who were afterward called <hi>Iſmaelites</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> as they named themſelves for their greater credit, as if they came of <hi>Sarai.</hi> And ſpiritually under the name of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> the Apoſtle under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the wild and ſavage nature of man brought forth by the firſt Covenant, <hi>Job</hi> 11.12. which becomes ſo much the more fierce when the Law goes about to tame it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9.13. And therefore <hi>Jeremy</hi> compares the rebellious <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to a wilde Aſſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.24. which cannot be tamed, <hi>Job</hi> 39.<note place="margin">Gal. 4.30, 31.</note> And therefore muſt be caſt out. Thus what was foretold of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob, the elder ſhall ſerve the yonger, Gen.</hi> 25.22, 23. was not fulfilled in the perſons of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> but rather the contrary, as appears by their whole ſtory, wherein <hi>Jacob</hi> ſubmitts almoſt in all things to <hi>Eſau.</hi> But this was fullfilled in their poſterities, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.14. And this was expreſsly fortold by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.23. and accordingly underſtood and interpreted by the prophet, <hi>Malach.</hi> 1.2.3.4. Thus ſpiritually <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> figured the former and the latter world, 2. <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 6.8, 9. Yea, the earthly and the heavenly man, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47. Thus what is written of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> that <hi>Ephraim</hi> the younger ſhould be the greater, we read not to have been fullfilled in their perſons, but in their poſterities, that <hi>Ephraims</hi> Tribe exceeded his brothers in number, <hi>Num.</hi> 1.32, 33, 35. And in place and dignity, <hi>Num.</hi> 2.18, 20. The like we muſt here underſtand of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Canaan.</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65717:69"/>Dutch. Howbeit, according to another ſignification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the French, Genevah, and our old Engliſh Tranſlation turns it <hi>to perſwade;</hi> and <hi>Munſter</hi> howſoever he be ſway'd by the authority of the Rabbins, and ſo turns it <hi>inlarge,</hi> yet he confeſſes, that the word is uſed in the Proverbs often <hi>to perſwade:</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly <hi>Tremellius</hi> turns the word <hi>Alliciet, God ſhall intice,</hi> and <hi>Oſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Perſuadeat, Let God perſwade.</hi> And though we put <hi>inlarge</hi> in the Text, as <hi>Diodati</hi> alſo doth, we have perſwade in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe two ſignifications, there is alſo a third, and that is <hi>Condecoret,</hi> Let God beautifie <hi>Japhet.</hi> This tranſlation hath authority from <hi>Jonathans</hi> paraphraſe who underſtood the Hebr. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and comely; and therefore he renders the words, <hi>Let God beautifie the borders of Japhet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are three interpretations of the word, and every one hath reaſon to ſpeak for it ſelf; and the Tranſlators are Stiff and reſolute each for his own. And why may not the words, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fullneſs of the Spirit, bear all three ſignifications, and all of them conſonant unto the truth and the Analogie of faith? Words have their bounds. The Spirit hath one. And therefore ſince, according to Divine artifice and skill, the Spirit of God hath couch'd ſo many ſignifications under one word in the Text, I dare not ſo make choice of one that I ſhould wholly reject the other two; and therefore as <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.8. The new wine is found in the cluſter, and one ſaith, deſtroy it not; for a bleſſing is in it; So I may ſay of theſe ſignifications, reject neither one nor other, for a bleſſing is in it, part of <hi>Japhets</hi> bleſſing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it as we might finde in them all, but I ſhall ſpeak of the two former onely as moſt conſonant to my ſcope; and firſt of that which our tranſlators have made choiſe of, and put in the Text; <hi>God ſhall Inlarge Japhet,</hi> or as the words are <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>God ſhall inlarge unto Japhet,</hi> vizt. <hi>his habitation or dwelling,</hi> unto which the following words have reference.</p>
               <p>When God is ſaid to in large <hi>Japhet</hi> we muſt underſtand this either according to extenſion, outwardly and literally, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to intenſion, inwardly and ſpiritually.</p>
               <p n="1">1. According to extenſion and outwardly, God may be ſaid to inlarge <hi>Japhet,</hi> when having increaſed his poſterity, he makes room for them in the world, as he did when he gave them all the Iſlands and Peninſula's, as <hi>Britany, Jreland, Thule, Creta Sicilie,</hi> &amp;c. the Peninſula's <hi>as Spain, Italy, Greece,</hi> &amp;c. In a word, all <hi>Europe;</hi> which became the moſt populous of all the three parts of the world, the ſeat of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and added alſo the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> and part of <hi>Armenia, Jberia, Albania,</hi> and thoſe vaſt regious towards the North heretofore

Becauſe thoſe parts are extream fruitful, I ſpeak not of the earth, but of men, which in all ages they have power'd forth into other parts of the world, and enlarged their dwellings. And thus God inlarg'd <hi>Japhet.</hi>

True it is, the good man was excuſable who till then knew not the ſtrength of wine; Nor did the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks for 1600 yeares; they lived without wine all their life, without which ſome of us cannot live one day.</p>

But alas! what benefit is it unto them, or us, <hi>to know God when we worſhip him not as God?</hi> What profit is it for them or us to boaſt of God, that we know his will, when yet we do it not? Yea, what a ſhame and diſorder is it to know ſo much, and do ſo little? —<hi>Pudet haec opprobria nobis &amp; dici potuiſſe, &amp; non potuiſſe refelli.</hi> Yea what a terror it is? And how ought it to trouble us, ſince he that knowes his Maſters will and does it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes?</p>

               <p n="1">1. What it is to perſwade; it ſignifies to induce, lead, or draw one by arguments and reaſons to think, believe, and do ſome thing; yet ſo, that there is a power left to deſſent. Thus when we commend ſomething as honeſt, honourable or profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and exhort to the doing of it, by motives, reaſons, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, we may be ſaid to perſwade. And this I much ſuſpect was the reaſon why the major part of our Tranſlators caſt the word <hi>perſwade</hi> into the margent; becauſe they conceived, that God acts upon the minde and will, not by motives and reaſons inducing it to believe, and ſo leaves it free; but by a <hi>ſuper pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> overpoyſing it, and determining the act of it, and ſo here not perſwading, but <hi>inforcing Japhet to dwell in the tents of Shem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The event of perſwaſion is either belief of what is perſwaded unto, or unbelief. Now becauſe that whereunto God perſwades, cannot but be good, what is that good whereunto God may be ſaid here to perſwade <hi>Japhet.</hi>

Thus the Lord perſwaded <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.7.

Yet where any are ſaid to believe, the Miniſter is not ſaid to cauſe that belief, though he propound the object of faith, though he inſtruct, though he exhort men to belive, and uſe motives and inducements of all kindes, and meanes and helps. All which are ſuch as are ſufficient for the producing of belief, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.1. But that they may be effectuall and thorowly perſwaſive, and work that belief, it is Gods guift.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65717:73"/>this day, that are ſo converted? The fail therefore ſeems to be in the inſufficiency of the meanes. 'Tis poſſible there may be a fail in regard of the meanes. But I beſeech yee, who of us layes the blame where it ought principally to be layed? even upon our ſelves. We read and heare what yet we practice not. Whats the reaſon; we are not perſwaded of the truth that is delivered. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Walk in love, as Chriſt loved us, Epheſ.</hi> 5.1, 2. Who is there that will lay down his old hatred, his deadly fuid againſt his neighbour, and ſo <hi>walk in love?</hi> He believes not that he ought to walk in love, or if he do believe that he ought to walke in love, yet it is onely to thoſe that love him, it is not <hi>ſo as Chriſt loved us:</hi> How was that? when we were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. he believes not that, and therefore loves them not, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is exceſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Would a man be drunk every other day (as many are, to ſay no oftner,) would they if they believed this, and that God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them? But we want means; <hi>John</hi> 6. <hi>No man can come unto me, except the Father draw him.</hi> How doth the Father draw men? How otherwiſe then with the cords of man, whereby it is fit a man ſhould be drawen? Thou pretendeſt, thou haſt not grace; and if it pleaſed God to give thee grace, thou wouldeſt do thus, and ſo: Thou Hypocrite! <hi>Thou draweſt iniquity with cords of vanity, and ſin as with Cart-ropes,</hi> and expecteſt, that God ſhould force thee againſt nature, and againſt grace. Is this to draw with the cords of a Man, or with the cords of a Beaſt? yea, the Beaſt it ſelf is not ſo drawen.</p>
               <p>I have ſhewen, I am perſwaded undeniably, that its a rare thing, that any believer ſhould want power to do what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.18, 19. Thou art even like the brethren of the rich man in Hell; they had the means of grace, &amp;c. but that would not ſerve their turn: the rich man tels <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>if one came from the dead, then they would believe.</hi> They were a knot of good fellowes, like their brother, and they were ſo accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to <hi>fare deliciouſly every day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 16.27.31.</note> they were ſo ſerviceable one to others humour, that they durſt not diſpleaſe one another.

We ſee the truth of Gods promiſe made unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Japhet</hi> and his ſons to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem,</hi> that they make the principall part of the Church. For allthough ſo <hi>rich is our God towards all that call upon him</hi> that he excludes not any, no not the poſterity of <hi>Ham,</hi> out of <hi>Shems</hi> houſe, <hi>where there is neither Greek nor Jew,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11.

               <p>Yea this promiſe to <hi>Japhet</hi> is ſo performed, that <hi>Shems</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity is cut off, and <hi>Japhet</hi> dwells in his Tents, the Gentiles Church have the name of <hi>Jſrael, Mich.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>And he is a Jew which is one inward, Rom.</hi> 2.</p>

               <p>I have conſidered hitherto <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet, Ham</hi> and <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſeverally, and apart, both in their hiſtory and in their myſtery. Come we now to the Conſideration of them joyntly.</p>
               <p>The moſt antient hiſtorians, and from them the Poets among the Heathen tell us, that <hi>Saturn</hi> was the firſt father of all, after the flood. And therefore <hi>Orpheus</hi> calls him <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Moſt certain it is, that truth is more antient than a lie, or fable. For a lie is the corruption of truth; and truth is the ſubſtance and foundation of a profitable fable. And therefore it ſuppoſeth truth before it. The Mythologie therefore and truth of his fable, is this. Whereas <hi>Saturn</hi> is ſaid to have devour'd all his children; it is to be underſtood that <hi>Noah,</hi> whom they meant by <hi>Saturn, condemned the world,</hi>

               <p>And truly it very nearly concerns every one of us, to beware and take great heed of the direful increaſe of ſin: For as it is true and well known, <hi>Bonum eſt ſui diffuſivum,</hi> That which is good, is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65717:79"/>diffuſive of it ſelf; ſo is it as true, that <hi>malum eſt diffuſivum ſui,</hi> evil is alſo of a ſpreading nature. It begins in the fanſie and vain thoughts of the earthly man, which knowing no better thing then earthly objects, things neer a-kin unto it, and delightful unto ſenſe, it eaſily draws the concupiſcence unto them. Which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever according to original rectitude, it propends to good, and that <hi>Bonum honeſtum,</hi> and is ſubject to the rational appetite, and ſo to right reaſon, (as the Philoſopher could ſay,) and right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Law of God; yet having declined from that firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity unto the ſenſible, preſent, and delightful good, which moſt-what is diſ-joyn'd from the true and honeſt good, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more and more prone unto evil: as he that's falling down a ſteep precipice, eaſily falls lower and lower <hi>Dum in profundum venerit peccatorum,</hi> (<hi>Prov.</hi> 18.3.

                  </gap>, the Rudder of the ſoul; as he that's ſinking, will lay hold though on his beſt friends, and pluck them with him into the ſame pit of deſtruction. And the reaſon it ſelf being brought off to <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> that rebellious party, like <hi>Ahitophel</hi> fallen off to <hi>Abſalom,</hi> the faction growes ſo ſtrong, that <hi>the heart gathers iniquity to it ſelf, Pſalm</hi> 41.6. and takes delight and pleaſure in it: So that <hi>when the man does evil, then he rejoyceth, Jeremy</hi> 11.15. Then <hi>Nimrod</hi> is come to <hi>Aſhur,</hi> then the rebellious heart is come to its happineſs. This great miſchief proceeds from a very ſmall beginning. The contagion of this leproſie begins with a ſpot, and ſpreads it ſelf over the whole man. It kindles from a ſpark; and then <hi>iniquity burns all before it like a fire.</hi>

               <p>And as unſatiable is the tyranny of iniquity. For <hi>Nimrod</hi> the Rebel having gotten an hold in the ſoul, leaves it to iniquity in ſucceſſion.

Whence it was that he refuſed all the ſpoyles which the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> offered unto him; he expected his reward from him, <hi>who had choſen him to be a ſouldier.</hi> We may therefore rather think that <hi>Abram</hi> (after ſo great a victory,) was wiſely provident and wary leſt the <hi>Babylonians</hi> or <hi>Canaanites</hi> might ſurprize him; and leaſt his good ſcceſs ſhould make him ſecure. As it is ſaid to one of our antient Kings;

                  </q> The Lord therefore ingaged himſelf for his pay; promiſeth himſelf for his protection, and encourageth him by both. From this gracious promiſe, <hi>Abram</hi> gathers in upon his God, and is imboldened to ask a Son and heir of all his goods. Many goods God had given him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. but no child, no heir, to poſſeſs them after him. <hi>Lord God what wilt thou give me ſeeing I go child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs? my ſervant will be mine heir.</hi> It is one of the great evills of barrenneſs, <hi>Haeredem habere non ſuum.</hi> There is nothing will ſatisfie <hi>Abraham</hi> but a Son and heir.

The heaven and ſtars were made for this very end. 3. And more ſpecially the Lord promiſeth <hi>Abram</hi> a ſon by ſhewing him the heaven and ſtars, that there might be ſome proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what he promiſed, and the ſign whereby he confirmed it.

Yea the Church according to the letter and old forms of godlineſs, and according to the newneſs of the Spirit is compared to heaven.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65717:83"/>and at his ſecond coming he ſhakes the Church, Eccleſiaſticall men, and the Earth, the Potentates, Polititians and worldly wiſe men. And he has ſhaken to the purpoſe, and will yet ſhake them.</p>

               <p>The thing here witneſſed to be believed, is the promiſe of God to <hi>Abram,</hi> that he ſhould have a ſeed, a numerous or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſeed, a vertuous and heavenly ſeed.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65717:85"/>not only in the <hi>truth</hi> of God, but in the <hi>power</hi> of God; God promiſed a thing extreem hard, yea by nature impoſſible, that <hi>Abram, whoſe body was now dead, and Sarah, who was barren and her womb dead, they ſhould have a ſon.</hi> Yet <hi>Abram</hi> believed.

                  <note place="margin">Tit. 1.2. Iohn 3.33.</note> then the ſoul cloſes with that, and ſeales to it. He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeal, that God is true.

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Here note a great miſtake in the underſtanding of theſe words. Its evident to common ſenſe, that <hi>Abram</hi> is here ſaid to believe, that God would give him an heavenly ſeed, and that exceeding numerous even as the Stars. The Text here mentions nothing at all, it ſpeaks not one ſyllable of the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt, his ſuffering, or death; but onely of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and bleſſed ſeed with ſhould be like the ſtars of heaven, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that however it be true, that the imputing of Chriſts obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſuffering in us and for us, be in it's right place firmely to be believed, namely as a deliverance from the curſe of the law, when we are dead to ſin, according to theſe and diverſe other Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.14. Yet is it not the argument of this place which is my Text, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the principal object of faith.</p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding of this, we muſt know that the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and divers other of his Epiſtles, endeavours to compoſe the differences between the Circumciſion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65717:87"/>circumciſion, between the Jewes and Gentiles, and ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf between them as an Umpir, of their controverſies.</p>
               <p>And in this chapter he endeavours to declare and prove that ſalvation brought by Chriſt is not beſtowed upon <hi>Abram</hi> and his ſeed neither out of Circumciſion, nor out of the law, nor workes of the law, which either <hi>Abram</hi> or any ſon of <hi>Abram</hi> hath done, but out of the free grace and bounty of God, who of his Clemency and mercy hath given us the ſalvation even Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, for what had either <hi>Abram</hi> or any of his ſeed done whereby he might either deſerve, or diſpoſe, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the mercifull God to give the redeemer, even the Lamb, to take away the ſinns of the world. The Son was moſt freely given, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 9.6. But that any man may pertake of that affluence of grace and ſalvation, it's neceſſary that he believe in him that gives the Son, that he hunger, and thirſt after the righteouſneſs, come unto him and drinke, and through the ſame faith receive the water of life, which may become in him a well of water, ſpringing up unto everlaſting life, <hi>John.</hi> 4. So that his faith is not barren, but fruitful, as having the fruits of the ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</p>

               <p>They believe not his power, that he is able to ſubdue all the enemies of the life in us; that he is able to make us clean. Yet they believe, that the enemy is able to make a man perfectly wicked,<note place="margin">Num. 14.11.</note> as the Philoſopher calls <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which is to think, eſteem, reckon, impute.</p>
               <p>It is uſed in Scripture in regard of ſin 1.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.19. Pſal. 32.2.</note> negatively, as to diſcount it, to diſcharge it, not impute it unto the ſinner; <hi>Let not my Lord impute iniquity to me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Shimei</hi> to <hi>David.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of righteouſneſſe affirmatively; and ſo to impute for righteouſneſs,<note place="margin">Pſal. 106.30. with Num. 25 12, 13.

               <p n="3">3. To count or impute faith for righteouſneſs or to eſteem it as righteous, may be two wayes underſtood.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either as faith in Chriſts obedient death, the attonement for our ſinns is accounted to the belief for righteouſneſs, whereby the ſinner is acquitted and pardoned, as if he were innocent and had not ſinned. 2. Or elſe as faith in the truth, and power of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65717:88"/>God, who promiſeth, and is faithfull and true, and able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what he promiſes, is imputed for righteouſneſs. The latter is here meant, as it is evident in the Text. Thus <hi>Abram</hi> believed in God promiſing him a ſon, and able to perform what he promiſed.</p>
               <p>And herein lies no ſmall part of our happineſs, that though our natures were fully repaired, by ſanctification and holineſs, which is the poſitive part of righteouſneſs, yet unleſs the guilt of our former ſinns be taken away by non-imputation, pardon and forgiveneſs of our old ſinnes, we ſhould yet periſh.</p>
               <p>What is it then to be juſtified? not to be imagined righteous,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.10. Pſal. 24.5. Jer. 23.6.

                  <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Why did the Lord count faith to <hi>Abram</hi> for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? 1. Whither can this imputation be referred but unto the gratious eſtimation of God, whereby he is pleaſed to over-value the act of his creature wrought by his power, and eſteeme it, and reward it above the worth of it? 2. That reaſon which may be conſidered in regard of <hi>Abram,</hi> was the glory he gave unto God by believiug in his truth and power. For he who believes, and truſts in another, hath an high opinion of him, that he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and true in what he ſpeakes, and is able and willing to effect what he promiſes.</p>
               <p>If any unexperienced chapman ſhould come to one of you, and profeſs his ignorance in the commodity, he is to buy; and ſay, that he relied wholly upon you, and truſts you, ye will not deceive ſuch a man; The deceiving of confidence is the very worſt of all deceipts.

               <p>Hence ſome of great name collect theſe conſequences, how truly, I ſay not; 1. That <hi>Abram</hi> was one who wrought no
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65717:89"/>works of righteouſneſs, but only believed in God: and 2. That God juſtifies the ungodly; ſo that, though they be lewd and ungodly, yet he accounts them juſt: what ſtrange collections are theſe; yet ſuch, as I fear, too many make from theſe words. Yea 3. Hence it will follow, that he is a bleſſed man, who hath only the non-imputation of his ſin, whoſe ſins are forgiven him, though otherwiſe he be a ſinful man. Let us anſwer to theſe three doubts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſeems, that <hi>Abram</hi> wrought no works of righteouſneſs. Why? <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifies the ungodly, &amp;c.</hi> he works not but believeth.</p>
               <p>We muſt know therefore that the Scripture makes no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition between good works, and believing in him, that juſtifies the ungodly; but the oppoſition lies between the works of the Law, without faith, and with excluſion of faith, and belief on him that juſtifieth the ungodly. For without doubt to walk in good works,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.10.</note> and to do works of righteouſneſſe is the end for which man was created: we muſt know therefore that the Apoſtle diſputes with the Phariſees againſt works wrought by their own power,<note place="margin">Col. 2.12. Gen. 26.5.</note> not againſt ſuch as proceed from faith in the operative power of God, by which <hi>Abraham</hi> obtained a glorious teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſeems that God, when he imputes faith for righteouſneſs, <hi>juſtifies the ungodly.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 23.7. Prov. 17.15. and 24.24.

How then can God be ſaid here <hi>to juſtifie the ungodly?</hi> I have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewen, that God then juſtifies the ungodly, when he takes away his ungodlineſſe from him. It is not therefore to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> as if then, when God had juſtified the ungodly, he yet continued ungodly; but <hi>in ſenſu diviſo, God ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies the ungodly, by taking away his ungodlineſſe from him.</hi> And thus <hi>Abram</hi> being yet an Idolater, as <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> and divers of our own gather out of <hi>Joſ.</hi> 24.2. he believed in God, who juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Abram,</hi> and took away his idolatry and all his ſins from him, and made him of an Idolater, a worſhipper of the true God; of an ungodly man, a godly man; ſo God juſtifies the ungodly. And thus <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Reprof</hi> Second. Thoſe who juſtifie themſelves by fancy, who imagine that becauſe they believe that Chriſt hath done and ſuffered all things for mans ſalvation, and theirs in ſpeciall, this faith ſhall be imputed unto them for righteouſneſs, though they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65717:90"/>yet live not by faith, yea, though they live in open and notorious ſinns: But perhaps the Lord accounts thoſe ſinnes dead, and reputes thoſe dead workes only as infirmities and weakneſſes of the Saints. Very likely; As if ſin were then mortified and dead when it is only thought to be ſo; As if to be baptized into Chriſts death, were only to have our ſins called by new names, as weakneſſes, infirmities and frailties, which were deadly ſins before we imagined them to be dead. By this meanes we ſhall have wicked mens couſenage, murder, drunkenneſs and adultery, and the Saints couſenage, their murder, their drunkenneſs, their adultery the very ſame ſinnes, only fanſied otherwiſe, new Chriſt'ned and called by other nam's; as ſerving-men are ſaid to be drunk, and their maſters ſick; when the diſeaſe is one and the ſame. And many like prodigious unheard of diſtinctions of ſins. Thus becauſe Chriſt was ſober, therefore the believing drunkard ſhall be counted ſober, by Chriſts ſobriety. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt was chaſt, patient, loving, &amp;c. Therefore the believing letcher, wrathful, envious perſon ſhall be counted chaſt, patient, loving. Why? becauſe Chriſts chaſtity, patience and love is imputed to him.</p>
               <p>O' beloved! Let not us be deceived; for God is not, God cannot be deceived; He alwayes accounts ſin, ſin. He never accounts a covetous man, liberall; nor a drunkard, ſober; nor a letcher, chaſt; nor an angry man, patient; <hi>He judgeth righteous judgment,</hi> ſhall <hi>I count them pure with the wicked balances and with the bag of deceitfull weights?</hi> Saith the Lord, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.11. No; This is the time foretold by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Eſay 32.8.</note> 
                  <hi>when the vile perſon ſhall be no more called liberall, nor the churl bountifull; but the liberall perſon deviſeth liberall things, and by liberall things ſhall be ſtand. He that doth righteouſneſs is righteous even as God is righteous.</hi> Saith S. John, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7.</p>
               <p>O beloved! there is no marvell that the hand of God is ſtretched out ſtill, ſince in this day of his judgement there is no true faith to be found, little other righteouſneſs, no better juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation then this.</p>

               <p>Howbeit, herein I cannot juſtifie our Tranſlators, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no doubt, theſe three notable ſignifications of the word, they have waved thoſe two, which are more proper, and made choiſe of the third; becauſe, as I fear, ſome of them might think, it made for the eſtabliſhing their opinion of <hi>deſtiny and fatality.</hi> But herein they were much deceived, as I hope to make it appear in the handling theſe three Axioms. Let us begin with the firſt.</p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:65717:94"/>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord <hi>corrected</hi> the woman. 1. By the woman under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Church, or ſuch as are now to be reformed and made the Church of Chriſt. 2. What Lord is this, and to which of the three witneſſes doth it belong? its evident from his act of correcting, that it is the father to whom the Law is attributed, by which he corrects.<note place="margin">Pſal. 40.8.</note> 3. How doth the Lord correct the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? The Lord corrects the woman either inwardly or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
               <p>Inwardly, as by every word of God, ſo ſpecially by his law; and this he doth in the thoughts and affections of men,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16. Pſal. 94.12.</note> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing unto the conſciences of men their evil thoughts, intentions, and purpoſes, and ſinful affections, wills and actions, contrary to the law of God. <hi>Thou thoughteſt wickedly, &amp;c. but I will reprove thee, and ſet before thee the things that thou haſt done.</hi> He reproves the vain thoughts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.</p>
               <p>The Lord corrects alſo outwardly, and that by manifold wayes. <hi>Elihu</hi> tels us of ſome, <hi>Job</hi> 33.19. And <hi>David,</hi> when thou with rebukes doeſt chaſten men. But as in other duties, ſo in this eſpecially, God makes one man a kind of god unto another, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo homini deus.</hi> Thus either the voice from the life reproves, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. or the life it ſelf. Let the righteous ſmite me and reprove me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.5. Whence</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. See an <hi>oeconomie</hi> and diſpenſation of God the Father, whereof there is little notice taken in the Chriſtian world. There is much talk of the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt, which is the diſpenſation of the Son, but little ſpeech is made of the law of God the Father and correction by it neceſſarily preceding the Goſpell of the Son.<note place="margin">Iohn 5.17.21.</note> For as there is a work of the Son, ſo is there alſo a work of the Father. Ye read of the Father's <hi>raiſing of the dead,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>as well as the Sons.</hi> And as there is a ſhape and forme of Chriſt in thoſe who believe and obey the Goſpell of the Son;<note place="margin">Iohn 5.37.</note> So is there a forme and ſhape of God the Father in thoſe who believe and obey the law of God the Father.</p>
               <p>God the Father firſt prepares the woman by correction and diſcipline, and inſtructs her, and he then appoints her as a ſpouſe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65717:94"/>for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Firſt the Father teacheth and brings up <hi>Diſciples under the law;</hi> and then he directs them to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Seal the law among my diſciples,</hi>

This law therefore is ſaid to be a <hi>Schoolmaſter unto Chriſt.</hi> Now Chriſt receives thoſe diſcipled by the Father, and they become his diſciples while they abide in his word; Love one another; and out of faith working by love, bring forth much fruit.</p>
               <p>Whence it evidently appears, that what ever diſciples may be ſaid to be the Sons, they were firſt the Fathers; He framed them and faſhion'd them by correction and inſtruction, and ſo appointed them out for the Son. <hi>The men that thou gaveſt me out of the world, Thine they were.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 17.6.</note> Theſe the Father appoints out and gives to the ſon. Hence we read of the Church <hi>in God the Father and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the Apoſtles Epiſtles unto the Churches to which he wrote.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. Behold what is the beſt <hi>Reformed Church;</hi> ſurely it can be no other than that which God himſelf reformes and corrects. That congregation of men whom God hath reformed and faſhioned anew, in whom is the ſhape and form of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axiom.</hi> 2. The Lord <hi>prepared</hi> a wife for <hi>Jſaac.</hi> The fulneſs of the holy word is wonderfull; which truely cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by one tranſlation; and therefore, by divine direction, what one renders one way, another turns another way, and ſo a third and fourth, according to the various ſignification of the Scripture, and all true. That which els where often meets us, the ſame is here in the Text; where the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">1. Literally. And ſo the reaſon why the Lord appointed a wife for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> is the purſuance of his own firſt ordinance and inſtitution, for the propagating of an holy ſeed. He alone as he knowes the hearts of all the children of men, ſo he faſhions and fits them in a mutual harmony one towards another. And in this ſenſe <hi>A prudent wife is from the Lord, Prov.</hi> 19.14.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a great myſtery; for I ſpeak of Chriſt and his Church. A and ſo doth <hi>Moſes</hi> here, when he tells us of Gods <hi>appointing out</hi> a wife for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> hereby we myſtically un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to be meant the pre-ordaining and chooſing a Church for Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſer.</hi> The <hi>oeconomy</hi> and diſpenſation of the father. When <hi>Abraham</hi> ſendes his ſervant, and he provides a wife for his Maſters Son, and tranſacts the whole buſineſs without <hi>Jſaac</hi> his interpoſing; What can we gather hence, but <hi>Abrahams</hi> fatherly providence for his Son, and <hi>Jſaac's</hi> obedience and ſubmiſſion unto his fathers will?</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch as theſe are good morall obſervations and all that the miniſtry of the letter will gather from hence. But we may further obſerve, that the ſpirituall <hi>Jſaac</hi> intermedles not with his own wife; She is firſt diſcipled, fitted, inſtructed and every way prepared by the Father; and then appointed out to him. And therefore it was not without a great myſtery, that <hi>Adam</hi> muſt be caſt into a dead ſleep, when his wife was taken out of him. The Mother of all the living ones, the ſpouſe of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> is taken out of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> now crucified as in a dead ſleep upon the croſſe and maried unto him who is raiſed from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. And herein was <hi>Iſaac</hi> alſo made like unto the Son of God, who had now a wife provided for him without his knowledge, when by his own will, that is, his humane judgment, he neither takes nor rejects any ſoul. For <hi>I came not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to do mine own will, but the will of my father, Joh.</hi> 5.30. and 6.37, 38. <hi>I came down from heaven not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if I be <hi>appointed out</hi> for <hi>Jſaac, Eliezer</hi> will take me. If God hath <hi>appointed me</hi> to ſalvation, I ſhall have remiſſion of ſins and amendment of life. If I ſhall be ſaved, God will bring me to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65717:96"/>the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.47. If I be ordained unto eternall life, I ſhall believe, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. Theſe are perverſe diſputings of men of corrupt minds.</p>
               <p>If God hath appointed thee to ſalvation, he hath alſo corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thee, nurtured, chaſtened, and inſtructed thee, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fitted thee by his law for his ſon the ſpiritual <hi>Iſaac.</hi> And then thou muſt be corrigible, teachable, pliable, and yielding. The Lord chooſeth ſuch ſons to be partakers of his holineſſe and righteouſneſs, that is, of Chriſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. What wiſe father will match his ſon to one baſe born? now if ye refuſe chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ye are baſtards, and not ſons, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.8. If God hath appointed unto thee his kingdom, it is as he hath appointed it unto Chriſt; and how was that but by temptations, by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by death? For ought not Chriſt to ſuffer theſe things, and <hi>(ita,</hi> ſo, Vulg. Lat. and <hi>Caſtellio) to enter into his kingdom? that ſo ſuffering with him, we may reign with him, Luke</hi> 22.29. and 24.26. <hi>Put on as the elect of God, bowels of mercy, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſts Spouſe. The Spouſe of Chriſt is <hi>all glorious within, bowels of mercy, kindneſs, humbleneſs of minde, meekneſs, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, &amp;c. her clothing is of wrought gold,</hi> that is, <hi>charity:</hi> that is, her upper garment is love to God her neighbour, her enemy; <hi>Above all theſe things put on charity, Col.</hi> 3.14. God the Father does not appoint a mercileſs, unkinde, proud, impatient Spouſe for his Son; he has not choſen a Scould, but one clothed with bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of mercy, &amp;c. He hath appointed a Spouſe for his Son ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all the vertues and graces of the Spirit. He hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a naſty Slut.

If the Phyſitian ſhould leave purging, If the Phyſitian of thy ſoul ſhould leave correcting thee and chaſtening thee, and preſcribing cordialls unto thee, If he ſhould give thee over, there were ſome cauſe of fear.

Wherefore if good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given, why we ſhould adhere to that expreſſe text of Scripture, rather then recede from it, it will be of more weight with reaſonable men then all mens authority againſt it. Let us try.</p>
               <p>The great name <hi>Tetragrammaton Jehovah</hi> is ſo compoſed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine artifice, that it ſignifies the three parts of time, paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come; as I have ſhewen largely on <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.26. When therefore the Lord calls himſelf <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, [I will be], he implyes that in the later part of time, he will more clearly manifeſt his Deity in and to the Humanity. That we may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, we may obſerve, that the whole tract of time from the beginning to the end of it, may be generally divided into two parts or ages; one of type, propheſie, and promiſe; the other, of truth, fulfilling, and performance of what was typified, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and promiſed. And this later eminently began when Chriſt appeared in the fleſh; and therefore we finde ſo often, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>S. Matthew, ut impleretur,</hi> that it <hi>might be fulfilled, &amp;c.</hi> This time is expreſſed in the Prophets often by <hi>The laſt dayes, thoſe dayes, that time, &amp;c.</hi> which the Apoſtles call <hi>the end of the world, the later times, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, although <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaks of his own times and calls them <hi>the ends of the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. yet he tells us alſo of <hi>later dayes which ſhould come</hi> after his time, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1.5.</p>
               <p>Now the Lord and his Prophets foretelling what ſhall come to paſſe, they refer us in the firſt age or part of time to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of it in the later part of time. So we underſtand what our Lord ſaith to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 6.2. that <hi>He was not known to Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, by his name Jehovah,</hi> that is, as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported a <hi>fulfilling of his promiſes;</hi> otherwiſe no doubt he was known by that name unto them. And the Prophets point at the <hi>later times</hi> for the fulfilling of their propheſies: Examples are obvious, as very often when we meet with this phraſe, <hi>They ſhall know that I am the Lord,</hi> often in <hi>Eſay, Jeremy, Ezechiel, &amp;c.</hi> And they refer us unto the <hi>later times</hi> for a more cleer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of what they write, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.20. And the reaſon is, becauſe in the Meſſiah, the Lord would more clearly manifeſt himſelf and his wayes and works. So <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Afterward ſhall the children of Iſrael return and ſeek the Lord their God, and David their King,</hi> and ſhall fear <hi>the Lord and his Goodneſſe, in the later dayes.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>, and an <hi>outward</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as made up into fleſh. Between theſe two is <hi>his voice,</hi> to whom the Lord hath appeared; and it is <hi>verbi vehiculum,</hi> the Vehicle, the Chariot of the Word, which conveighs it unto the heart of the hearer. As <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt calls himſelf the <hi>voice of the cryer,</hi> for the ſame reaſon.</p>
               <p>The Evangeliſt firſt deſcribes the <hi>inward word, John</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and that Word was God.</hi> Then before the eſſential <hi>Word</hi> was to be uttered, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the <hi>voice. A man ſent from God, whoſe name was John; the ſame came for a witneſs to bear witneſs of the light, that all men through him might believe.</hi> Then he deſcribes the <hi>Word made fleſh and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in us,</hi> which cries in <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> is the <hi>voice of the Crier;</hi> who hath cried in all men who have ſpoken any divine truth, from heaven, even from the beginning, ſaith V. <hi>Bede,</hi> as yet it doth; ſometime informing and inſtructing, ſometime checking and reproving, ſometime complaining, ſometime comforting; whither are to be referred all the acts of conſcience, which are Gods <hi>cryings</hi> in the ſoul. And thus Chriſt <hi>cried</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) unto the Spirits in priſon. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, 19. Thus Wiſdom or Chriſt cries, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20. 1. and 8.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:65717:109"/>
               <p>This inward eſſential Word muſt firſt be in, and appear in thoſe who are the vehicles of it unto men, before they can be the <hi>voyces</hi> of God and Chriſt <hi>crying</hi> unto them. For ſo <hi>the Son muſt firſt be in S. Paul, before he could preach him among the heathen, Gal.</hi> 1.16. This was that whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> here doubted; <hi>They will not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hear</hi> (<hi>or hearken after the inward word</hi>) <hi>in my voice; for they will ſay, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee;</hi> and ſo <hi>not ſpoken in thee and by thee.</hi> Thus the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſought a proof of Chriſt ſpeaking in <hi>S. Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. And therefore the Lord furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth <hi>Moſes</hi> with miracles to perſwade the people, that he had ſpoken by <hi>Moſes.</hi>

               <p>To thee be it ſpoken, who ever thou art who calleſt thy ſelf <hi>A Miniſter of the Word.</hi> Look into thy ſelf, whether the Lord and his living word hath <hi>appeared</hi> in thee, and <hi>ſpoken in thee,</hi> or no; and whether by thy <hi>voice, that word</hi> be conveyed unto men; ſo that they, who <hi>hear thee,</hi> may be truly ſaid to <hi>hear Chriſt ſpeaking in thee, and by thee,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1. <hi>If that word be in thee, thou oughtest to ſpeak, Acts</hi> 13.15. If yet thou doubt, whether they will believe thee, (becauſe <hi>all are not workers of miracles,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29. Yea, <hi>John Baptiſt was a Prophet, and more then a Prophet,</hi> Matth. 11.9. <hi>yet did no miracle, John</hi> 10.41.) live thou the life of that word, unto which thy voice gives teſtimony, and that life ſhall be <hi>the light of men,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.4. And becauſe that life of God is ſtrange and rare in the world, it will perſwade more then the word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1, 2. more then many miracles. <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhorted, that with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of heart the <hi>Antiochians</hi> ſhould cleave unto the Lord; for he was a good man, and full of the holy Ghoſt and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23, 24.</p>

For what, through want of due regard, is neglected, the ſame adviſedly conſidered of, may provoke admiration. And a very powerful means this ſeparation was to perſwade the heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> into an acknowledgement and admiration of Gods great power, if he had not hardened it, but rightly thought on the exact diviſion that God made between the good and the evil,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65717:111"/>the oppreſſed, and their oppreſſours, the Iſraelites and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians. Yea, not onely between <hi>their perſons,</hi> but alſo between their cattle, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.4. where the Lord makes the like won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſeparation.</p>
               <p>The end which the Lord herein aims at, is, that <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> yea, and all ungodly men in the world might be induced to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the divine power and God-head, <hi>Romans</hi> 1.20. and ſo be brought to believe in God the Father.</p>

               <p>By like wonderful ſeparation in diſtributing rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments in the world, the Lord begins the firſt diſpenſation, and advanceth belief in God the Father.</p>
               <p>Such a marvellous ſeparation the Lord made when he divided <hi>Noah</hi> and his family from the world of the ungodly; <hi>Lot</hi> and his houſhold, from the <hi>Sodomites;</hi> and the obedient, who, at Gods command yielded themſelves captives to the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> from thoſe who diſobeyed and remained in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Which the Prophet compares to good and evil Figs.

Which becauſe it cannot be done without depreſſing our earthly and carnal thoughts, and raiſing up our ſpiritual and heavenly, the Pſalmiſt addes thereunto, <hi>Selah:</hi> which therefore is far from being <hi>a meer Muſical Note,</hi> or <hi>dictio ſine ſenſu, a word without a meaning,</hi> as yet ſome have thought, I ſay not how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily of any part of Gods Word.

               <p>This is Gods conſtant providence in the world, though in ſome examples more eminent than others; whereby he leaves not himſelf without witneſs unto any perſon or nation. So that when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> fruſtrated the end of Gods goodneſs towards himſelf, as all Atheiſts and Epicureans do, he and they ſin againſt much light. For God the Creator, who made us this ſoul, he knows his own work, and how men are apt to reaſon from their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of humane counſels, actions, and their events: ſo that when they ſee (as they may ſee, if they will be patient and duly conſider) a marvellous ſeparation of the good from the evil, a requital of the good with good, and the evil with evil; they may hence collect, that there is a Wiſdom, Juſtice, Power, and Goodneſs, acting and ruling in the world, ordering and diſpoſing humane actions unto their reſpective ends, even the <hi>Lord the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in the midſt of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This marvellous ſeparation of the good from the evil, the good God therefore makes, that men may acknowledge and own his <hi>eternal power and God-head;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now it reſts to be inquired into, whether is the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meaning of the words, and whether ſuits beſt with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. That of the Tranſlators is this; <hi>I know, that ye will not yet fear the Lord God.</hi> The other, I know that ye are afraid of the face of the Lord God before I pray.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> is deſired to pray to the Lord, and that earneſtly, that the thunders and hail may ceaſe. Whether diſpoſition of theſe two, is the more likely to encourage <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to pray unto the Lord for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his ſervants; and more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to incline the Lord to hear their prayer. According to the former, <hi>Moſes</hi> knew, that they would not yet fear the Lord. What incouragement could this be to <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray for them? <hi>They did not yet, nor would they yet fear the Lord: therefore pray and pray earneſtly.</hi> How does that follow? <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in the <hi>gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity, intreated Peter to pray for him, Acts</hi> 8.24. but we read no anſwer that <hi>Peter</hi> made to that motion. What incouragement had he to pray? Nor is it likely, that the Lord ſhould be inclined to hear <hi>Moſes</hi>'s prayer for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his ſervants: For upon like conſideration the Lord forbids <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy to pray for his people, Jer.</hi> 11.14. and 14.11.</p>
               <p>The other diſpoſition is this. <hi>I know that ye are afraid of the face or preſence of the Lord before,</hi> that is, <hi>before I pray.</hi> This diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be a good motive unto <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray for <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as for his own ſinful people now under a ſlaviſh fear, <hi>Exodus</hi> 33.4, 5, 6. And the like fear might incline the Lord in like caſe to ſpare <hi>Pharaoh</hi> as he did <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27, 28, 29. and <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> and his people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.1.—7.</p>
               <p>It is clear, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his ſervants were, for the preſent, in a more hopeful condition to be praid for, according to this later tranſlation, then they are according to the former. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks doubtfully of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his ſervants, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they were in a mutable ſtate under ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fear. <hi>Ye are afraid of the face or preſence of the Lord before I pray for you;</hi> whereby is implyed a contrary diſpoſition feared to be in them, which would be diſcovered after he had prayed for them. While the judgement was upon them, they feared; but when that ſhould ceaſe, they alſo would ceaſe to fear, and would return to their own inclination.</p>

                  <hi>Moſes</hi> full well knew the falſe and corrupt nature of men. So true is that Diſtich, and the Engliſh of it;
<q>
                     <l>Daemon languebat, Monachus tunc eſſe volebat:</l>
                     <l>Daemon convaluit, Daemon ut ante fuit.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Devil was ſick, then he a Monk would be:</p>
               <p>The Devil was well again: the Devil a Monk was he.</p>
               <p>Our corrupt nature is ſo baſe and ſervile, its far better when its kept under, then when it is at liberty. Thus it was under the Law, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.21. And thus it is and hath been in the time of the Goſpel: For the Church of Chriſt was more pure, holy, juſt, loving, patient, long-ſuffering, &amp;c. in the time of the Apoſtles, and afterward until <hi>Conſtantines</hi> dayes, then ever it hath been ſince in any age. Our own experience may prove this, within theſe few years; that the lives of men profeſſing religion, were more ſober, juſt, godly, and every way more truly Chriſtian, when there was a power over them to check them, then ever they have been ſince, while men may do what they liſt.</p>
               <p>How many examples might be given for proof of this, in theſe our dayes, of Cheaters, of Gameſters, of Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, of Drunkards, &amp;c. who while the Lords hand is upon them, by ſickneſſe, or otherwiſe, while <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, his threatnings are thundred out againſt them by the Sons of Thunder, O how humble they are! how prodigal of large promiſes of amendment! how full of confeſſion of ſin! juſt like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> here, how firmly (a man would think) do they binde themſelves with vowes and promiſes! How humbly do they deſire <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron to pray, and that much</hi> for them? Yet <hi>when the Philiſtines are upon them,</hi> (<hi>Potione cadentes,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>Philiſtine</hi>) when their Pot-companions reſort unto them, they break all vowes, all covenants with God and men, as <hi>Samſon</hi> brake his cords.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> well know, that theſe <hi>Egyptians,</hi> (or, as we call them in our Engliſh, theſe <hi>Gypſies, are afraid of the face of the Lord before they pray for them;</hi> and that upon their recovery, they will return to their own byaſs.</p>
               <p>The Iſrael of God hath better learn'd Chriſt, and well knows, that it is more noble to be brought off <hi>by the whiſper of Gods voice perſwading us, then by his terrible thunders threatning us; rather by the goodneſs of God leading us, then by his ſevere judgements driving us to repentance.</hi> But the good God ſanctifie every diſpenſation unto us which may win us unto himſelf, whether it be <hi>His Rod, or his Spirit of Meekneſs!</hi>

               <p>Fire is natural, and indifferent, or ſpiritual, and that good or evil.</p>
               <p>The <hi>roſting</hi> by a natural fire is the drawing of crudity and rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs out of the meat.</p>

                  <hi>Myſticè.</hi> But the ſpiritual fire is here to be underſtood, and that which is good, and that either good in it ſelf, or good for us.</p>

               <p>How ſhall the <hi>Paſchal Lamb be roſted?</hi> When they roſt meat, the ſuperfluous moyſture and crudity is dried and drawn out of it.

               <p n="2">2. The Word is moſt ſavoury, when we partake of it in our afflictions, then it has the beſt reliſh. At other times it is like meat to men that have no appetite. But when we are under the fire of afflictions, preſſures, and calamities, O how ſweet the Word is then unto us! as to <hi>the hungry ſoul every bitter thing is ſweet, Prou.</hi> 27.7. as a morſel cut off the Spit.

                  <hi>Doubt.</hi> Why does the Lord propound theſe myſteries under outward things, as of a Lamb, &amp;c. Love is defined <hi>affectus uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> an affection of union, oneneſs, and ſameneſs with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty loved. Now becauſe one man who loves another, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be one and the ſame with him, <hi>Diſparata non poſſunt fieri u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> diſparates cannot be the ſame; he imparts ſomething to him wherewith he may be in a ſort one and the ſame with him: ſuch is that which enters into us, as our meat and drink; and ſuch as is neareſt to us, as our garments and what elſe is needful for the preſervation of our being. Thus <hi>Jonathan</hi> loved <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.1, 3, 4. Their ſoules were in a ſort one: but how did <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> expreſſe that? <hi>He stript himſelf of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, &amp;c.</hi> Does the Scripture, think we, intend only to expreſs humane paſſion? <hi>Jonathan</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures the holy Spirit; (ſo his name ſignifies, <hi>The gift of the Lord,</hi>) and he clothes <hi>David;</hi> as when <hi>Judges</hi> 6.34. the Spirit of the Lord is ſaid to come upon <hi>Gideon,</hi> the Hebrew Text ſaith, <hi>the Spirit clothed Gideon. Rom.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Being affectionately deſirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you our own ſouls, becauſe ye were dear unto us.</hi> There is no love without communication of ſomething from the party loving to the party loved. Thus <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved,—that he gave his only begotten Son. Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>He loved me, and gave himſelf
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65717:120"/>for me. Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Chriſt loved us, and gave himſelf for us. So he loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, ver.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>And thus the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to teſtifie his intimate love unto us, he communicates himſelf unto us by the Sacrament of his body and blood; which is called therefore <hi>Sacramentum uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> whereby he affectionately imparts himſelf unto us, <hi>John</hi> 6.55, 56, 57. <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, &amp;c. He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, &amp;c.</hi> Terms of art are as weights wherewith we weigh ſilver and gold. And ſuch are the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and vertues in them, and conveyed by them. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>ſpiritual things have no proper name of their own,</hi> ſaith <hi>Dion. Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opagita,</hi> its neceſſary, that if we muſt know them, they borrow the ſymbolical repreſentations of themſelves, from outward and ſenſible things, whereby they may be accommodated and fitted unto our underſtanding: For it is impoſſible, ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that the Divine Ray ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſhine unto us, then as it is inveloped and hidden in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of holy coverings. Seeing therefore that which we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of in the Sacrament inwardly is a ſpiritual thing, and the very ſame ſpiritual grace, whereof the Iſraelites were partakers in the Paſsover; and even the Iſraelites and we <hi>(Surrogatus Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,)</hi> the true Chriſtian Church <hi>eat of the ſame ſpiritual meat, and drink the ſame ſpiritual drink,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. The difference of the outward Elements makes no difference in the ſpiritual grace. For Chriſt, of whom we partake in the Sacrament, is properly no more Bread and Wine, then he is Manna, and Water out of the Rock, then he is the meat and drink Offering, then he is a Paſcal Lamb. All which ſignifie Chriſt. The difference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is only in the outward ſignes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. As there is an inward <hi>hidden man of the heart,</hi> a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and heavenly man;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.4.</note> ſo in reaſon there muſt be an inward ſpiritual and heavenly food, which he inwardly feeds upon, and wherewithal he is inwardly nouriſhed. And therefore when our Lord had ſpoken of his body and blood to be fed upon and drunk, he ſaith, <hi>My words they are ſpirit, and they are life:</hi> even the truth of God: <hi>Veritas eſt animae pabulum,</hi> the divine truth is the food of the ſoul, the <hi>Paſcal Lamb, the ſpiritual meat,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2, 3. <hi>That bread of God which comes down from heaven, John</hi> 6.33. <hi>That hidden Manna, that food which endures unto the everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All this is Chriſt the truth, the ſpiritual Bread, Meat, Manna, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Lamb.</hi> And this is that which the true believer inwardly eats and feeds upon in the holy Sacrament. This is that which our Lord meant, when he ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. <hi>This is my body, this is my blood, &amp;c.</hi> For ſurely his natural body, his outward fleſh and blood was preſent with them at the Table; and of that he could
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65717:120"/>not be underſtood to ſpeak, but of his inward and ſpiritual body and blood, which he gave, even his living Word and Spirit. Of this he ſpeaks fully, <hi>John</hi> 6.48.—58.</p>

He ſhall offer it for <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>favour</hi> to himſelf from the Lord. And accordingly the Lord makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of acceptance, verſe 4. On the contrary, the Prophet tells the Jews in the ſame expreſſion, Your whole burnt-offerings <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are not to acceptation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.20. This hath been the moſt ancient tranſlation of this Scripture. So the LXX <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, He ſhall bring it acceptable. So the Chald. Par. the Syriac, Arabic, and Samaritan verſions: the Vulg. Lat. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther,</hi> three Low Dutch tranſlations, the Tigurin Bible, and <hi>Caſtellio,</hi> and of our old Engliſh, <hi>Coverdale</hi> and another. And to this I rather encline; becauſe the whole burnt Sacrifice offered to the honour of God, prefigured the <hi>body of ſin to be deſtroyed;</hi> and that ſervice accepted through Jeſus Chriſt, of the Lord.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the Lord loves a <hi>cheerful giver,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. I dare not reject that other tranſlation. Yea, why may we not, according to that admirable fulneſs of the holy Word, admit of both? Namely ſo that the mortifying Spirit of God excites the <hi>Good will</hi> of him who offereth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>according to his
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65717:134"/>own will;</hi> that the Son (through whom we offer up all our Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.15.) meets him who <hi>offers willingly.</hi> That the Father, through the mediation of the Son, <hi>accepts</hi> of him who ſo <hi>willingly offereth,</hi> and his offering <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to <hi>his grace and ſavour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus is the ſervice of God pourtrayed in the ceremonies of the Old Teſtament, eſpecially in this myſtical Book ½ and lively repreſented in the New.</p>
               <p>Since the Lord promiſeth ſo gracious <hi>acceptation,</hi> let us be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged <hi>willingly to come,</hi> and bring our whole burnt offering [the dally mortification of our ſin] through the mediation of the High Prieſt; ſo ſhall we and our Oblation <hi>finde acceptance</hi> in the Beloved, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6.</p>

               <p>I note this the rather, becauſe of that almoſt general neglect of Gods Commandements, held by ſome not to belong to a Chriſtian man; by others, to be impoſſible to be kept through the grace of God by any man: and this opinion amounts to the ſame in effect with the former; whereas theſe three verſes, beſide ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold other Scriptures, forcibly prove, that, as the Lord requires both of the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> of the <hi>Ruler,</hi> and all and every one under his power, an univerſal regard to be had to <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every one</hi> of his Commandements; ſo he ſuppoſeth, that <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every one</hi> of theſe, have reſpect unto <hi>all</hi> the Commandements of God, and to <hi>every one</hi> of them; in that he preſcribes an offering, in caſe any one of them hath broken <hi>one Commandement,</hi> and that out of <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>errour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly the like care and obſervation, yea, greater ought to be had by us Chriſtians, in reſpect of all &amp; every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God. For although it be now almoſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed, that there is ſomething to be remitted and abated of the ſtrictneſs and rigour of the Law in our Evangelical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in regard of that which was required of them who lived under the Law, that aſſertion is altogether groundleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true; which yet therefore hath obtained belief and approbation amongſt moſt men, becauſe it is eaſie: For they love an eaſie reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion a-life, <hi>Proclives à labore ad libidinem,</hi> men by corrupt nature hate what is hard and difficult, &amp; love their eaſe. But the Goſpel indeed requires more obedience of us then the Law; which may appear, as by that which our Lord affirms, <hi>Except your righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> (which yet was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>the moſt ſtrict Hereſie,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.5.) ye ſhall by no means enter into the kingdom of heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. As alſo by our Lords expoſition of the Law, that the obligation of it reacheth to the ſoul and ſpirit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.21, &amp;c. Yea, the penalty of diſobedience to the Goſpel, is more grievous then that for the breach of the Law: For if the <hi>word ſpoken by Angels</hi> was ſtedfaſt, and <hi>every tranſgreſsion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience</hi> received a juſt recompence of reward, how ſhall <hi>we</hi> eſcape, if <hi>we neglect ſo great ſalvation? Hebr.</hi> 2.2, 3. and 10.28, 29.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65717:136"/>He who <hi>deſpiſed Moſes Law, died</hi> without mercy under two or three witneſſes: <hi>How much ſorer puniſhment</hi> ſhall he be thought worthy of, who hath <hi>troden under foot the Son of God? &amp;c.</hi> And great reaſon there is: For where the Lord hath given more grace, he may juſtly expect more obedience and duty from us, according to our Lords rule of equity, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.48.</p>
               <p>Let us well conſider this O Reader, who ever thou art, and let us conſcientiouſly regard <hi>every one</hi> of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and take great heed, leſt we break any <hi>one</hi> of them; ſince he who breaks but <hi>one</hi> Commandement, is guilty of <hi>all, James</hi> 2.10. As in a copulate Axiom, ſaith the Logician, <hi>one falſe part</hi> renders the <hi>whole Axiom</hi> falſe. And a Chryſtal Glaſs or Mirrour, though broken but in one part, yet the whole Glaſs is ſaid to be broken: And one breach made in the Glaſs of righteouſneſs, the holy Word of God, renders the <hi>whole</hi> broken.

               <p>O how careful of theſe things were the Ancient Doctors of the Jewes Church!

                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:65717:137"/>precepts are 365, anſwerable to the number of <hi>Nerves and Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> in mans body, as the <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> have obſerved. By theſe are <hi>united</hi> the forees and powers and ſtrengths of the inward and ſpiritual man, which muſt be <hi>knit</hi> together, that the Spirit may come and dwell in it.

And our obedience hereunto muſt be perpetual, as figured by the dayes of the year, of the ſame number, 365.</p>
               <p>Of all theſe, ten only were written in the Tables which God gave to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 34.28. as being the radical and principal Commandements unto which, all the other may be reduced. And theſe are fitted to the <hi>number of our fingers,</hi> the inſtruments of our work.

               <p>The reaſon why the <hi>Lawes of God were thus multiplyed,</hi> appears from the <hi>neceſsity</hi> of man to whom theſe Lawes were given; and the <hi>great goodneſs and mercy of God</hi> the <hi>Lawgiver.</hi> Mans <hi>neceſsity</hi> was great; he had a grievous fall, even from Heaven to the Earth; even from an heavenly minde and affections, unto both earthly; from wiſdom to fooliſhneſs, ignorance, and errour; from rectitude and uprightneſs, to obliquity and crookedneſs; from one to many, from the Creator to the creatures.</p>
               <p>When therefore the man hath loſt his happineſs in the <hi>one and only God,</hi> he ſeeks and hunts for it, among the <hi>many creatures.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what the Wiſeman ſaith generally of all men, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.19. God made man <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the word is appellative, not proper,] God made thee, and me, and every perſon <hi>upright;</hi> as appears by the oppoſition following; but <hi>they</hi> have found out <hi>many inventions.</hi> He is ſaid to have <hi>forſaken the fountain of living waters, Jer.</hi> 2.13. There muſt therefore have been ſome time when he enjoyed it and had union with it. He is ſaid to be <hi>aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> from the life of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. Sometime therefore he <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> that life. He is ſaid to have <hi>fallen,</hi> and therefore ſometime he had <hi>ſtood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now being <hi>fallen from unity and uniformity, to multiplicity,</hi> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, partiality, diſtraction, diſcord, diſagreement of minde, fanſie, thoughts, underſtanding, heart, will, affections, all theſe diviſions and partialities both one from other and in our ſelves; hence appears the great <hi>neceſsity</hi> of a manifold law, which might purſue the man in his <hi>manifold aberrations and ſtrayings</hi> from his God; which might follow him in every thought, will, deſire, affection, and ferret him out of every hole. So that theſe <hi>many lawes</hi> are a certain badge and evidence of that <hi>manifold miſery,</hi> whereinto we are fallen. For, as <hi>Plato</hi> reaſons, Where there are many <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> it followes that the people muſt have many <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</hi>

Nor is there any ſin that the man commits, but, among the <hi>manifold negative</hi> Commandements, there is a prohibition of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe Commandements of God are ſometime delivered in full decalogue; ſometime contracted into a leſſe number, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12. Sometime to a leſs then that, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.16. and yet to a leſs number, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.8. The ſame, upon the matter, with what we read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.23. Yea, our Lord reduces them to two, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.36.—40. Can they yet be brought to a leſs number? <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.9, 10. Love is the fulfilling of the Law. All the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements <hi>affirmative and negative</hi> are contracted into one.</p>
               <p>O conſider this, who ever love God and his righteouſneſs, who have been long buſied about the <hi>multitudes</hi> of Gods Lawes. Let us have reſpect <hi>unto all the Commandements, Pſal.</hi> 119.6. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Gods righteouſneſs thrives in us, he will abbreviate and make ſhort his Commandements, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.28. The end of the Commandement, is love out of a pure heart, and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and faith unfained, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. that moſt excellent way, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. which is violently broken from the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter. Wherein <hi>S. Paul</hi> tells us, what that moſt excellent way is, even Charity; greater then Faith and Hope, ver. 13. That bond of perfection, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.14. that new and old Commandment, Love; that we walk after his Commandements, 2 <hi>John</hi> 6. the new and old way; wherein if we walk, we ſhall finde reſt unto our ſouls, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.16.</p>
               <p>Let us haſten to that unity, that <hi>one</hi> Commandement, that day of love. Let us haſten the coming of <hi>that day,</hi> that one day, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.7, 8, 9.

That the <hi>day would haſten to come to us;</hi> not that we ſhould <hi>haſten to the coming of the day.</hi> But ſuch is the goodneſs of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> that <hi>he ſhines alone in his Saints;</hi> (as <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Sol,</hi> the Sun, have their names from ſhining <hi>alone,</hi> ſaith <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>) when his day-light appears.

                  </gap>, that he ſhould be King. And of like nature is this Scripture: If the high Prieſt (ſo the Chaldy Paraphraſt and the LXX here underſtand him) <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ſin to the guilt of the people,</hi> or, <hi>to the ſin</hi> of the people, <hi>to make them ſinful and guilty.</hi> So the Chald. Par. If the great Prieſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſin to the ſin of the people;</hi> and the LXX clearly render the words ſo, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, if the high Prieſt being anointed ſin <hi>to cauſe the people to ſin,</hi> or, <hi>that the people ſin.</hi> Which muſt not be underſtood not <hi>on ſet purpoſe;</hi> for then it could not be <hi>a ſin of ignorance,</hi> (which, in this Chapter, is principally inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,) but a ſin of <hi>malitious wilfulneſs,</hi> which admits of no Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.26. but deſerves outting off, <hi>Num.</hi> 15.30.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Hierom</hi> alſo turns the words, <hi>Delinquere faciens populum, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the people ſin. So Vatablus,</hi> and the Tigurin Bible, <hi>Piſcator</hi> alſo both in his High Dutch, and Latin Tranſlation, turns the words thus, If the Prieſt <hi>ſo ſin that he brings a guilt upon the people.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Diodati;</hi> if the chief Prieſt <hi>ſo ſin, that the people is made culpable.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe, Luther &amp; three Low Dutch Tranſlations. There are alſo two of our old Engliſh Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that of <hi>Coverdale</hi> and another, which ſo render the words. <hi>Tremellius</hi> ſpeaks home to this purpoſe.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>for a guilt unto Iſrael.</hi> And <hi>Castellio</hi> having turn'd the words, <hi>ſi deliquerit in noxiam populi,</hi> if the Prieſt ſhall <hi>ſin to the offence of the people;</hi> he explains it in his Annotations; <hi>Cujus delicto, &amp;c. by whoſe fault, the people may be made guilty;</hi> as the

               <p>And this tranſlation may be confirmed by the conſtant tenor of the Scriptures; which blame <hi>not the people</hi> for the ſinnes of the <hi>Prieſts or of the Prophets,</hi> as the other tranſlation doth; but the <hi>Prieſts and Prophets,</hi> for the ſinnes of the <hi>people.</hi> Thus, <hi>for the ſin of Eli's ſons the Prieſts, the people abhorred the offering of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17. as he tels them ver. 24. Ye <hi>make the Lords people to tranſgreſs.</hi> And the Prophet, out of compaſſion toward the people, he tels them, O my people! they who lead thee, <hi>cauſe thee to erre, Eſay</hi> 3.12. and the like, Chap. 9.16. And <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.15. From the Prophets of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is prophaneneſs gone forth into all the Land; and 9, 10, 11. The adultery, ſwearing, or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and violence of the people, is laid to the Prophets and the Prieſts charge. And the <hi>Prophets and Prieſts</hi> are ſaid to have <hi>ſhed the blood</hi> of the juſt in the midſt of Jeruſalem, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.13. that is, by their ſins, they occaſioned them to be ſlain; as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 13.19. they are ſaid to <hi>ſlay the ſouls that ſhould not die.</hi> Yea, that whole Chapter is on this argument. And very often elſewhere the Lord takes up the ſame complaint againſt the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi> Whence it appears, that their <hi>ſin</hi> is <hi>peccatum peccans,</hi> a <hi>brooding ſin, which makes the people ſin,</hi> and becomes exceeding ſinful.</p>
               <p>Let them ſadly <hi>conſider this,</hi> who, I hope, <hi>out of ignorance,</hi> (as being themſelves deceived by their Authors, whom they follow,) <hi>teach the people ſuch doctrine,</hi> as, not <hi>accidentally</hi> and <hi>occaſionally,</hi> but <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>per ſe, cauſeth them to ſin;</hi> ſuch is that catechetical doctrine, <hi>That no man is able either of himſelf, or by any grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this life, perfectly to keep the Commandements of God, but doth daily break them in thought, word, and deed.</hi> Surely the people, to whom the Law was given firſt, thought themſelves able to keep it, as appears, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.3.7, 8. Nor did <hi>Moſes</hi> blame them for promiſing ſo to do; but he directs them how to keep it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6, 7, 8.—14. Other Scriptures ſound the ſame thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.1, 2, 3.6.10.32. &amp;c. and 130.8. and 138.8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.7. beſide ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold more Scriptures. It is true, that no man is able of himſelf, either to think a good thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. or repel an evil: But is not this a diſparagement unto the Spirit of God, that no man ſhould be able by any grace received in this life, perfectly to keep the Commandements of God, but doth daily break them in thought, word, and deed? I ſhall inſtance but in one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If what is there delivered be true, what then is meant by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. God ſent his Son in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh, that <hi>the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> who walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit?</p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:65717:139"/>
               <p>Is God the Father and Son utterly fruſtrate of their end, ſo that the <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled in no man?</hi> It is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious teſtimony, that the Scripture gives to <hi>Joſiah,</hi> that he turn'd to the Lord with <hi>all his heart,</hi> and <hi>with all his ſoul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moſes,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.25. I can hardly be perſwaded that he brake the Law <hi>daily in thought word, and deed,</hi> no, though he lived in the time of the Law. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle profeſſeth himſelf to be one in whom <hi>the end</hi> which God the Father and Son aimed at, <hi>is obtained,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>I am able to do all things</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>through Chriſt who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly enables me; Phil.</hi> 4.13. And I hope there are ſome ſuch in the world.</p>
               <p>Whether now, this, and other ſuch doctrine do not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately tend to <hi>make the people ſin,</hi> let any indifferent man judge. For whereas they are taught, that no man is able, no not by any grace received in this life, perfectly to keep the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, but doth daily break them in thought, word, and deed, who will go about to do that, which, as he is taught, no man can do, nor is it poſſible to be done?</p>
               <p>Surely, if the Teachers and people lived exactly according to this and ſome other like doctrine, they would be the very worſt Chriſtians in the world; whereas truly I think there are of both, very vertuous and good men; and of the Teachers, many very learned alſo, and that in the <hi>truth, which is according to godlineſs, Tit.</hi> 1.1. which is the beſt kinde of learning. But I doubt not to ſay, that nither that life nor learning proceeds from their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but as <hi>Tully</hi> writes of ſome Philoſophers whoſe principles were corrupt, <hi>naturae bonitate vincuntur,</hi> they are better then their principles.</p>
               <p>Now I beſeech my Brethren, who are Teachers of the people, impartially to conſider what befel ten of the twelve Spies who taught the ſame doctrine; and the people who were perſwaded by them, <hi>that their enemies were too ſtrong for them; that they were not able to overcome them,</hi> and ſo to enter into the holy Land: Which is the ſum of <hi>Numbers</hi> 13. and 14. where verſe 11. the Lord complains of the people, <hi>that they believed him not;</hi> How long, ſaith he, will it be yer they <hi>believe me, for all the ſignes that I have ſhewed among them?</hi> He had promiſed them the holy Land, and he had evidenced by many ſignes and wonders that he was <hi>able to effectuat</hi> what he promiſed; yet <hi>they believed not.</hi> For whereas there is in Faith a <hi>Duplex formale objecti, verum, &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens,</hi> our faith looks at two things in God whom we believe, <hi>His Truth,</hi> and <hi>His Power, Rom.</hi> 4.20, 21. And if the teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe, be of things practicable, things to be done, or left undone, belief is a <hi>confidence</hi> 1. <hi>in Gods Truth,</hi> that, what he ſaith, is firm and ſure; 2. And in Gods power, who commands,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65717:139"/>forbids, promiſeth, or threatneth, that God is able to do, and enable the believer to do what he commands, and to ſhun what he forbids; able to fulfil what he promiſeth, and what he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, &amp;c. Now, whereas neither the ten Spies, nor the people, believed the Lords <hi>truth and power,</hi> the Lord ſware that they ſhould not enter into his reſt; and accordingly the ten Spies died, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.36, 37. and the carkaſes of the people fell in the Wilderneſs. <hi>David</hi> applies this ſtory ſpiritually to the men of his age, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. And the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.7.—19. to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church. Where verſe 18. to whom ſware he, that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, <gap reason="foreign">

The Spirit of God leaves this conſideration upon our ſpirits. We know, the Lord promiſed to them a good land, and to us the <hi>Land of uprightneſs, Pſalm</hi> 143.10. He promiſed them to be with them, to the ſubduing of the inhabitants of the land, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.10. and had given good proof of this, and a ground to believe this, by deſtruction of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Nor is there any believer who hath made any progreſs <hi>in the faith,</hi> but he hath had ſome experience of what God hath promiſed, that the Lord will not leave us nor forſake us, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.5. Whence he may gather-in upon our good God, and believe that he will fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his work; as <hi>David</hi> reaſoned, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.32.—37. And <hi>S. Paul</hi> touching the <hi>Philipians, Phil.</hi> 1.6. and himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.18. I was <hi>delivered from the mouth of the Lion; and the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preſerve me unto his everlaſting kingdom.</hi> That people <hi>believed not</hi> the Lord, notwithſtanding their knowledge of his <hi>power,</hi> that he was able to ſubdue their enemies: nor do many of the ſpiritual Spies or Teachers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>believe.</hi> Whereupon neither that people, nor many of ours can enter into Gods eternal reſt, becauſe of <hi>unbelief.</hi>

               <p>O my Brethren! doth not this come to paſs by reaſon of this doctrine of <hi>unbelief</hi> and <hi>impoſsibility of obeying the law and will of God?</hi> And how great then muſt our ſin be, if we poſitively and directly teach this doctrine? We may eſteem the hainouſneſs of the <hi>ſin</hi> by the <hi>offering</hi> enjoyned for the expiation of it: which is greater then any <hi>private mans,</hi> ver. 28. yea, greater then that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be offered by the <hi>Ruler,</hi> ver. 22. Yea no leſs then that which was commanded to be offered for and by the <hi>whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi> ve. 13.</p>
               <p>Conſider, I beſeech you, the many miſeries and calamities which have befallen thouſands both of Teachers and people in theſe late years; and the Teachers ſignally, their ejections and want of, livelyhood, being diſabled from teaching the people.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65717:140"/>I meddle not with reaſon of State. But when Iſee ſo heavy a judgement befal one profeſſion of men, and the moſt of them) I ſay not all: for I know ſome better minded) I fear, ingaged in the ſame doctrine of <hi>impoſsibility and unbelief,</hi> (as I have had it confeſſed by many of them.) I cannot but apply what the Lord hath threatned the Prieſts; The Prieſts lips ſhould keep know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and men ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth; for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts. But <hi>Corruptio optimi est peſsima.</hi> But ye are departed out of the way; ye have cauſed many to <hi>ſtumble</hi> (take offence, or fall) <hi>in the Law;</hi> ye have <hi>corrupted the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Levi,</hi> ſaith the Lord of hoſts. Therefore have I alſo made you contemptible and baſe before all the people, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ye have not kept my wayes, but have been <hi>partial in the Law, Mal.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9. And ſhall we think, that theſe who ſuffer theſe miſeries, are the only men who have <hi>cauſed the people to ſin by their falſe doctrine and ſcandalous life?</hi> Let them who think ſo, read <hi>Luke</hi> 13.1.—9. and with ſadneſs conſider that Parable, which our Lord there delivers, and fear, leſt the like or a worſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remains for themſelves.</p>
               <p>My Brethren! The hand of the ſame Lord of Hoſts is ſtretched out ſtill: And if we ſhall in life or doctrine, eſpecially this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>unbelief</hi> and <hi>impoſsibility, cauſe the people of God to ſin,</hi> let us fear the like, yea, heavier judgement upon our ſelves, becauſe we have not taken warning by the heavie hand of <hi>God</hi> upon them, <hi>Quorum facta imitamur, cur non &amp; illorum exitûs exhorreſcamus?</hi> If we be like them in the <hi>ſin,</hi> why ſhould we not fear, that we ſhall be involved with them in the ſame <hi>judgement?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We, who call our ſelves, and would be reputed Miniſters of the Goſpel, are ſuppoſed to know more then other men do; and to be more <hi>ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> then others are; and ſo to be more able to reſiſt the Tempter and his motions unto ſin. 2.

               <p>Then will our ſober, chaſte, temperate, honeſt, juſt, godly converſation win the people to ſobriety, chaſtity, temperance, juſtice, honeſty, and piety; and every grace which they ſhall ſee

               <p>Thus alſo in mens private affairs and extrajudiciall matters: As <hi>Abraham adjured</hi> his ſervant, or <hi>cauſed him to ſwear,</hi> impoſing an oath upon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.3. And examples of both kindes we have many in Scriptures, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.19. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.19. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.27, 28. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.43. <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.5. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.8, 9. and elſewhere.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Adjuration</hi> is underſtood in this Scripture here before us. For the Jews in their Courts admitted an <hi>Adjuration</hi> to be laid upon all perſons preſent, for the eliciting and drawing forth the truth in queſtion. Inſomuch as, although a man were not perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>cited</hi> and <hi>adjured</hi> to confeſs his knowledge, yet if he heard the <hi>adjuration</hi> or <hi>execration,</hi> and <hi>concealed the truth,</hi> he rendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf guilty, according to this Law. Much more, if any man were perſonally adjured to ſpeak his knowledge, and yet <hi>held his peace.</hi> In which caſe he was obliged to anſwer the <hi>adjuration,</hi> although poſſibly what he uttered, might prove diſadvantageous unto himſelf. So vain is that aſſertion, which yet is vulgar and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>that no man is bound to accuſe himſelf.</hi> This very Law bindes a man to <hi>ſpeak his knowledge,</hi> although ſummoned thereunto ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally only and in common with all who hear the <hi>adjuration,</hi> however his own perſonal intereſt may be concerned thereby. Otherwiſe this Law makes him guilty. How much yet more, if the Judge himſelf <hi>adjure</hi> him to declare the truth? In which caſe it is very obſervable, that, when the High Prieſt had queſtioned our Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.67, 68. and the falſe witneſſes had bin produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65717:141"/>againſt him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.61, 62. which yet could prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf held his peace; ſo that they were all at a loſs, the high Prieſt made uſe of the laſt expedient which, in this caſe, could be uſed, and <hi>adjured him by the living God,</hi> that he ſhould tell them, whether he were the Chriſt the Son of God. This <hi>Adjuration</hi> drew from our Lord that <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> that he was the Son of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.59.—64. For ſo, what there we read, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thou haſt ſaid, <hi>S. Mark</hi> reports to be, <gap reason="foreign">

So ſacred a thing is an Oath, that he who ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a <hi>Servant of Rulers,</hi> as he is called, <hi>Eſay</hi> 49.7. when he had ſtood dumb and opened not his mouth, the <hi>Adjuration</hi> cauſed him to make that glorious confeſſion of the truth.

But <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not any where uſed to ſignified <hi>blaſphemy</hi> in that ſenſe, ſo far as I yet can finde. Nor was <hi>ſwearing</hi> wholly forbidden the Jewes either judicially, or extra-judicially, but onely vain and falſe ſwearing, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.9. And of this <hi>ſwearing, Hoſ.</hi> 4.2. is to be underſtood, and <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.3. Every one that <hi>ſweareth</hi> ſhall be cut off. What kinde of <hi>ſwearing</hi> is that? It followes in the next verſe, every one that <hi>ſweareth falſly</hi> by my Name. So <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.5. For the merciful God graciouſly connived for a time at the Jewes <hi>ſwearing,</hi> ſo they <hi>ſware</hi> not <hi>falſly</hi> nor <hi>vainly</hi> by his Name. And therefore our Lord in his expoſition of that Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaith not, Thou ſhalt not <hi>ſwear,</hi> but thou ſhalt not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear thy ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reaſon may be. The people of God lived among the Nations, who walked every one <hi>in the name of his god, Mich.</hi> 4.5. Wherefore the Lord condeſcended for a time to be accounted as it were, a Topical God, as if he had been the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only; as may appear by <hi>Jephta's</hi> reaſoning, <hi>Judges</hi> 11.12.—28. leſt his people being mingled among the Nations, ſhould learn their works, and ſwear by other gods. See the truth of this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.14, 15, 16. Thus ſaith the Lord againſt all mine evil neighbours, &amp;c. it ſhall come to paſs if they ſhall diligently learn all the wayes of my people, to <hi>ſwear by my Name, The Lord liveth,</hi> as they have taught my people <hi>to ſwear by Baal,</hi> then they ſhall be built up in the midſt of my people. And we now live mixt one with another good and bad together, and every one endeavours to aſſimilate and render another like unto himſelf. O that every one of us, ſo far as we have attained, would endeavour to render another like unto God!</p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:65717:141"/>
               <p>Now although <hi>ſwearing by the Name of God, raſhly, vainly, and falſly, and without juſt cauſe,</hi> hath alwayes been a ſin, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 23.9.—13. Yet the univerſal prohibition hereof was reſerved until the time of Reformation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.33.—37.</p>
               <p>Howbeit that this kinde of <hi>ſwearing</hi> ought not here to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but <hi>Adjuration</hi> only, and to put an end to controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies among men, as hath been ſaid, will appear to be true, if we lay to the words now queſtioned and compare with them, what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.24. He that is partner with a thief, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his own ſoul; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he <hi>heareth adjuration,</hi> and <hi>uttereth it not.</hi> Where we have theſe very words of the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.1. and an exemplification of it. In this caſe the Arabic Proverb is not to be underſtood, Repentance for ſilence is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then repentance for ſpeech. And that of <hi>Cato</hi> hath no place here, <hi>Nam nulli tacuiſſe nocet, nocet eſſe locutum:</hi> For ſilence in this caſe argues a conſent unto evil.</p>
               <p>Take notice here, Chriſtian Reader, how ſtrict the Lord is in requiring a diſcovery of ſin, and that the truth ſhould be brought to light and judgement, and that under a ceremonial diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that he who <hi>concealed his knowledge, rendred himſelf guilty.</hi> And ſhall we who ought to depart from, and hate every evil way, and every iniquity, and loathe it in our ſelves, ſhall we hide and keep anothers ſin as ſweet under our tongue?</p>
               <p>In this caſe it will well beſeem our Chriſtian prudence and charity, to enquire what will be more profitable for our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reformation; whether to accuſe him and diſcover his ſin, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did his brethrens, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.2. or at leaſt for a time, with lenity and pious long-ſuffering to bear his weakneſs. But if we wink at, and diſſemble our brothers ſin, as if we favoured it, and waited not for a fit time for reproof of it, we make our brothers ſin and guilt our own; and our tenderneſs and clemency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our brother, will be interpreted no leſs then contumacy and diſobedience toward God. Remember how <hi>Solomon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> and with it I ſhall conclude this Eſſay, God will bring every work into judgement, and every ſecret thing whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 1. to <hi>cover,</hi> and 2. to <hi>purge, cleanſe</hi> or <hi>expiate.</hi> But although <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Thus the Tigurin Bible renders the words verbatim, <hi>Et expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit eum ſacerdos à peccato ſuo.</hi> And the Prieſt ſhall <hi>purge</hi> or <hi>expiate</hi> him from his ſin. And the Chald. Par. ſaith the very ſame, though ſomewhat otherwiſe tranſlated.

               <p>If meantime the ſin <hi>remain,</hi> how can the <hi>atonement</hi> or <hi>reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be made? ſince ſin is the only make-bate <hi>Quod turbat omnia,</hi> which therefore if it <hi>remain</hi> and be not really and truly remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and <hi>taken away,</hi> the <hi>wrath</hi> and the <hi>condemnation</hi> and guilt and obligation unto death muſt remain with it.</p>
               <p>What is wont in this caſe to be ſaid, <hi>that there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (which words are uſually cited alone, and the following words ſuppreſſed) it is true of them who walk <hi>not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit;</hi> whom the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>makes free from the law of ſin and death;</hi> in whom the <hi>righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled, Rom.</hi> 8.1.—4.</p>
               <p>It is true, theſe actions are all of them <hi>ceremonial,</hi> poor and beggarly rudiments; yet by them are figured out the pretious truths of God touching <hi>atonement</hi> with God and <hi>expiation</hi> from ſin, as gold is weighed out by braſs or leaden weights. The real <hi>purging</hi> from our ſins by Chriſt is meant by the ceremonial <hi>expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> wrought by the Prieſt and the ſacrifice. And therefore the Apoſtle ſo reaſons: if the blood of Bulls and Goats and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean, <hi>ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh</hi> (ſo far then it did <hi>ſanctifie,</hi>) how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered himſelf without ſpot to God, <hi>Purge your conſciences from dead works, to ſerve the living God?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>However, its clear from the words before us, that there is a difference between them. Let us learn from this diſtinction of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>treſpaſs,</hi> as alſo from the various names of them, not to content our ſelves in our confeſſions unto God, with a general acknowledgement, as, <hi>that we are ſinners;</hi> but, as particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were offered for them, ſo to make a more particular enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of our ſins. The Hebrew tongue, though it be very ſcanty and penurious of words, in compariſon of other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yet hath it very many words to expreſs <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> as <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide many words ſignifying more ſpecial ſins; importing ſins to be ſo many and manifold, that they cannot eaſily be expreſſed. The vain thoughts are dangerous in-mates, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. And there is no word ſo ſecret that ſhall go for nought, ſaith the Wiſeman, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 1.11. And we ſhall give an account of idle words in the day of judgement, ſaith the Wiſdom: <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. How much more of ſinful actions? Nor are all known unto us; for who
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65717:143"/>can underſtand his errours? Cleanſe thou me from ſecret <hi>faults,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> prayes, and may teach us to pray.</p>
               <p>But bleſſed be the Lord, that, though our ſins be numerous, yea, innumerable, yet he hath given us who believe and obey him, an High Prieſt, whoſe blood and ſpirit cleanſeth us from <hi>all our ſins,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. Yea, this King of Saints, and High Prieſt makes his believers and lovers, Kings (ruling over their own wils, affections, and luſts,) and Prieſts to ſanctifie and purifie others.</p>
               <p>That Prieſt, who makes the <hi>expiation,</hi> to him belongs the <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>treſpaſs.</hi> That's an hard ſaying; how belongs the <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>treſpaſs</hi> unto him? <hi>Levit.</hi> 6.26. The Prieſt who expiates the <hi>ſin</hi> ſhall <hi>eat</hi> it. And ver. 29. Every male among the Prieſts, ſhall eat thereof. And wherefore hath the Lord given this to the the Prieſts? <hi>Moſes</hi> tells <hi>Eleazar</hi> and <hi>Ithamar</hi> the ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that the Lord had given it them to <hi>eat,</hi> that they might <hi>bear the iniquity of the congregation, Levit.</hi> 10.17. So we read, that the Prieſts were to <hi>bear the iniquity</hi> of the Sanctuary, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.1, 2. It was the Prieſts duty to <hi>eat up the ſins of the people,</hi> as was ſhewen before, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.8. as by ſympathy <hi>bearing</hi> their <hi>ſins,</hi> as their <hi>own, ſuffering with them, praying for them,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This language is uncouth and ſtrange; and the duty of <hi>bearing and forbearing one another,</hi> hath been ſo long out of faſhion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially theſe times of violence and bloodſhed, that its hardly known to be the law of Chriſt to <hi>bear one anothers burdens, Gal.</hi> 6.2. And very few there are who are known to be his Diſciples or ſervants, by his <hi>Livery, John</hi> 13.34. A new Commandement do I give you, that ye love one another, <hi>as I have loved you,</hi> that ye alſo love one another. And why does our Lord repeat that duty? was it not enough to ſay, <hi>love one another as I have loved you,</hi> but he muſt inculcate the ſame again, <hi>that ye alſo love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> He the great High Prieſt loved us with an heroical love, with a love ſtrong as, yea, ſtronger then death; <hi>He eat up and conſumed, he bare and bears the ſins of many, Eſay</hi> 53.11. <hi>So he loves us,</hi> and his Commandement is, that we <hi>ſo love one another.</hi> And
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65717:144"/>that indeed ſuch an intenſe love is required of his Diſciples, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his Apoſtles exhortation unto it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1. Walk in love: how? <hi>As Chriſt loved us;</hi> And how was that? and gave himſelf for us an <hi>offering</hi> and a <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to God. This indeed is <hi>a new Commandement,</hi> and never before heard of; a <hi>Livery</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all men may know who are the Diſciples of Chriſt, there are ſo few who wear it.</p>
               <p>But leſt I be thought to urge this compariſon <hi>intenſis gradibus</hi> to the extent of it, and beyond our Lords and his Apoſtles drift, whereas our Lord and his Apoſtle meant it only in <hi>remiſsis;</hi> ſo that ſome ſmall meaſure of love might ſerve the turn, read what his beſt beloved Diſciple adviſeth touching this very argument. Hereby, ſaith he, perceive we <hi>the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us;</hi> and we ought to <hi>lay down our lives for the brethren.</hi> If this be well underſtood, that of <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> will not ſeem ſtrange, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>There are ſome pious and good men who affirm, that theſe <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> figured the <hi>perfections of all graces which are in Chriſt, who is the High Prieſt of our profeſsion, Hebr.</hi> 3.1. And there is no doubt but theſe ſpeak truth; for they are in Chriſt.

               <p>Surely therefore if Chriſt be <hi>in us,</hi> as according to this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he is, <hi>if we be in the faith,</hi> and <hi>not caſtawayes,</hi> that alſo which is <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> is <hi>analogically</hi> and <hi>according to our proportion of faith, in us</hi> alſo.

               <p>As for the <hi>Swan,</hi> the ſame author thinks ſome injury to be done to her, that ſhe ſhould, either under this name, or any other, be reckoned among the <hi>unclean fowles,</hi> and ſuch as are not to be eaten; ſince the Romans of old, ſaith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> were wont to put up their <hi>Swans</hi> and fat them, and eat them as a very rare diſh, as the Cygnets are accounted at this day.</p>
               <p>Although it cannot be denied but that the prohibition of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fleſh of certain <hi>beaſts, fowles,</hi> and <hi>fiſhes,</hi> imported unto If<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael according to the fleſh, an abſtaining from <hi>communion with the Heathen;</hi> by reaſon of divers analogies and proportions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: as was darkly intimated, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.

Alſo the viſion to S. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10. and the ſame occaſioned to be recited by him, Chap. 11. for greater confirmation, makes it clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Yet can we think, that, when now this diſtinction between the <hi>Jewes and Gentiles,</hi> is taken away, this Scripture is become uſeleſs, and like a Letter long ſince dated, which hath done its errand?

               <p>But how can the <hi>Prieſt</hi> be ſaid to <hi>pollute?</hi> ſome ſay, when he pronounceth him <hi>unclean</hi> and <hi>polluted:</hi> which alſo is true; but may he not be ſaid to <hi>pollute</hi> him who is <hi>unclean,</hi> when he leaves him in his uncleanneſs? according to that <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.11. He that is <hi>filthy,</hi> let him be <hi>filthy ſtill.</hi> And ſo the Lord is ſaid to harden, when he mollifies not the impenitent and obſtinate heart, but leaves it as he findes it, in its hardneſs. And when he cleanſeth not the <hi>unclean,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. He may be ſaid to pollute him. Not that he otherwiſe cauſeth any poſitive <hi>hardneſs</hi> or <hi>pollution.</hi> And herein the <hi>Prieſt</hi> is as <hi>the Lords mouth, Jer.</hi> 15.19.</p>
               <p>The Prieſt alſo, for like reaſon, is ſaid to <hi>cleanſe from pollution and ſeparate from uncleanneſs,</hi> when he <hi>expiates and purgeth away the true ſpiritual uncleanneſs:</hi> as very often in this book.

               <p>That <hi>Azazel</hi> ought ſo to be left untranſlated, and not to be rendred a <hi>Scape-Goat,</hi> may appear from this conſideration, that where ever either of the <hi>two Goats,</hi> is named in this Chapter, its never called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Munſter</hi> was aware of this; and therefore howſoever in the three other places, he tranſlates the word as ours do, yet in the laſt place, he tranſlates it not, but leaves it <hi>Azazel.</hi> Which alſo

                  </gap>. Now the people to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, are defiled with two kindes of ſins; whereof the one is <hi>open</hi> and <hi>manifeſt, Gal.</hi> 5.19. the other hath an <hi>appearance</hi> and <hi>ſhew</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſs, John</hi> 16.8. By both theſe we may underſtand the <hi>whole body</hi> of ſin to be deſtroyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. with both theſe the creature is polluted. The Body of ſin to be deſtroyed, is figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that <hi>Goat</hi> which is to ſent to <hi>Azazel,</hi> as by the <hi>Goats</hi> on the left hand in the judgement, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. And upon the head of this <hi>Goat</hi> the Prieſt muſt lay both his hands, and confeſs over him all the iniquities of the ſons of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in all their ſins, putting them upon the head of the <hi>Goat,</hi> and ſhall ſend him away by the hand of a fit man into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the <hi>Goat</hi> ſhall bear upon him all their iniquities, into a land of ſeparation, and he ſhall let go the <hi>Goat</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Now whereas the creature of God hath been polluted with the Body of known ſin and falſe righteouſneſs, it is not the will of the Lord, that his creature ſhould <hi>periſh in ſin;</hi> nor is it his will, nor is it poſſible, that his creature ſhould be <hi>ſaved in his ſin;</hi> which implyes a contradiction; becauſe <hi>to be ſaved,</hi> is ſo to be, from ſin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. And therefore the ſinful man ſignified by the <hi>Goat,</hi> which is for the Lord, ver. 9. muſt die from the ſin, he muſt be mortified, and the will in him unto ſin muſt be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead in him.</p>

               <p>We may ſee this prefigured unto us in the creature.

               <p>There is an earth that is the <hi>Serpents food, Eſay</hi> 65.25. which is indeed the <hi>terra damnata,</hi> the <hi>damn'd earth,</hi> the diſobedient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the diſobedient in their knowledge, who detain the truth of God in their unrighteouſneſs: Againſt theſe the wrath of God the Judge is revealed from Heaven.

               <p>O ye ſons of Iſrael! this neerly concerns us all.

               <p>Some have been very bold, in obſcurities of this nature, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to affirm, what others have as boldly denied; and both upon equal grounds, when neither party hath had authority of Scripture or ſound reaſon whereon to build his aſſertion.

               </p>
               <p>The Author of the former hath ſo curiouſly deſcribed Hell, and all the parts and nooks of it, and for what uſes the feveral Cels therein are, you would think, he had been there imployed as a <hi>Surveyor</hi> or a <hi>Viewer;</hi> ſo punctual he is in his relation and ſurvey of the place.

But as for the Philoſophers, and of them, the very beſt, we read of, he repreſents them living very holy lives, and leaving to poſterity very many divine ſayings, but at length like <hi>et Minos, Aeacas</hi> or <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> he adjudges them all to Hell, all to <hi>Azazel.</hi> O were it not much better, and more ſafe to examine our own lives, and conſider our own later end!</p>

               <p>But ſhould not Gods worſhip and ſervice, you'l ſay, be ſo dear unto us, that it ought to be preferred before our <hi>father and our mother?</hi> Men are wont in this and other caſes to plead for God, ſuch as they conceive him to be. Some there are who think that God ſees as man ſees; and that he is much taken with beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful out-ſides of Temples made with hands; and to ſuch uſe was that <hi>Corban,</hi> of which our Lord ſpeaks, for reparation of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And for <hi>this,</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees were zealous, and ſo zealous, that they preferred it before the <hi>Commandement of God.</hi> They knew not, nor do many know, or at leaſt they conſider not, that <hi>to do juſtice and judgement,</hi> is more acceptable unto the Lord then <hi>Sacrifice, Prov.</hi> 21.3. To <hi>obey</hi> is better then <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and to <hi>hearken</hi> then the <hi>fat of Rams,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22. So that our obedience unto the <hi>Moral Law</hi> of God, our <hi>love to our neighbour,</hi> our <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> unto <hi>parents,</hi> is more pleaſing unto him, then all his <hi>ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial worſhip and ſervice.</hi> Becauſe the Kingdom of God conſiſts in <hi>righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the holy Ghost;</hi> and in theſe things conſiſts our <hi>ſervice</hi> of God and Chriſt, acceptable before God and men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17, 18. Yea, without <hi>brotherly love,</hi> there is no <hi>love of God;</hi> For he that <hi>loves not his brother</hi> whom he hath ſeen, how can he <hi>love God</hi> whom he hath not ſeen? 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20. Therefore our Lord diſpenſeth with <hi>his own ſervice,</hi> when the <hi>brotherly love</hi> is wanting, till it be fulfilled; leave thy gift at the <hi>Altar,</hi> and <hi>go firſt</hi> and be reconciled unto thy <hi>brother,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> come and offer thy gift, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The more are they to blame, who by <hi>their practiſe</hi> violate this duty; a ſin very rife among us; and to be accounted among thoſe which have brought the wrath of God upon us in theſe laſt dayes.

And therefore it is a ſin worthy that <hi>puniſhment</hi> which the Lord hath denounced, great, as the <hi>reward</hi> is great.

               <p>There is no doubt but theſe prohibitions touching the <hi>perſons of the Prieſts,</hi> concerned literally and preciſely the <hi>ſons of Aaron,</hi> and the <hi>Levitical Priesthood</hi> and <hi>ſervice,</hi> ſo long as that laſted; as it may appear by two tacite limitations, in that he ſaith, <hi>Of thy ſeed,</hi> and <hi>in their generations, ver.</hi> 17.

               <p>And whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> told this not only to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons, but alſo to all the ſons of Iſrael, ver. 24. It ſeems that this divine law concerns, as thoſe who are in the <hi>Prieſts office</hi> who <hi>teach</hi> the

               <p>Howbeit although theſe <hi>blemiſhes</hi> excluded the <hi>ſons of Aaron in their generations,</hi> and reach not, according to the letter, unto the <hi>Goſpel Prieſthood,</hi> yet ſo far by analogy theſe prohibitions may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, as to bar <hi>deformed perſons</hi> from the exerciſe of that holy function, and to require <hi>decent perſons,</hi> if otherwiſe fit and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, to be admitted thereunto; yea, ſince there is nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the Word of God, contrary hereunto, there is no doubt but they who are in authority, may, by <hi>Eccleſiaſtical conſtitution,</hi> exclude ſuch as by ſome notable deformity vertually exclude themſelves.</p>
               <p>However, the <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> of this <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> may ſo far prevail even in theſe times of the Goſpel, as to diſable <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> from chooſing and deſigning ſuch of their <hi>children</hi> to the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> as are <hi>blinde</hi> or <hi>lame,</hi> or <hi>crook-backt,</hi> or have ſome other viſible <hi>biemiſh,</hi> for that reaſon, (a moſt unreaſonable one) <hi>even becauſe</hi> their <hi>children are ſo deformed.</hi> For why? they either think them fit for no other imployment: meantime they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not that <hi>curſe, Mal.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Curſed</hi> be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a <hi>male,</hi> and voweth and ſacrificeth unto the Lord a <hi>corrupt thing.</hi> Or elſe they look at the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> only as a lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, like a <hi>Corrodie</hi> of <hi>ſo much a year</hi> to maintain an Abby-Lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with what he may <hi>eat:</hi> In the interim they conſider not, that they expoſe their <hi>children</hi> to a <hi>curſe,</hi> like that on <hi>Eli's</hi> houſe, who ſhall ſay, (ſuppoſe to the Patron) <hi>Put me,</hi> I pray thee, into one of the <hi>Priests offices,</hi> that I may <hi>eat a piece of bread.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.36.</p>

Yea, ver. 19. he gives us that counſel expreſly, I call Heaven and Earth to record this day againſt you, that I have ſet before you <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death, bleſsing</hi> and <hi>curſing;</hi> therefore <hi>chuſe life,</hi> that both thou and ſeed may <hi>live.</hi> And accordingly as he inſtructs Iſrael to deal with the <hi>Canaaaites</hi> in their wars, <hi>Firſt,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim and invite them unto <hi>peace;</hi> which, if they embraced, well; if not, what remain'd but killing and ſlaying? <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.10.—13.

               <p>In the Chapter before us the Lord obſerves the ſame method: For having propounded the <hi>way of his Commandements,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted us to <hi>walk in his ſtatutes,</hi> and to <hi>keep his Commandements,</hi> and <hi>do them,</hi> ver. 3. He invites us <hi>first</hi> by the <hi>former kinde</hi> of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, <hi>temporal and ſpiritual bleſsings,</hi> and the very beſt of them both. The <hi>temporal,</hi> (though under them alſo <hi>ſpiritual</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd) <hi>plenty of corn and wine,</hi> with the cauſe of that <hi>plenty, rain in due ſeaſon.</hi> And becauſe <hi>plenty</hi> is a <hi>dangerous attractive,</hi> and oftentimes <hi>drawes</hi> enemies to ſhare with us, and hinder our quiet injoyment of it, he ſecures our fears of that <hi>danger,</hi> by promiſe of <hi>peace and ſafety.</hi> And whereas our <hi>peace</hi> might poſſibly be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrub'd either by ſome <hi>home-bred evil,</hi> or <hi>from abroad,</hi> he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>ſecurity</hi> in regard of both, ver. 6. I will rid <hi>evil beaſts</hi> out of the land; neither ſhall the <hi>ſword</hi> go thorow your land. But in caſe any ſhall be ſo bold as to make an aſſault upon us, they ſhall be repulſed with notable loſs; for <hi>five</hi> of you ſhall chaſe <hi>an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> and <hi>an hundred</hi> of you ſhall put <hi>ten thouſand</hi> to flight, v. 7, 8. And becauſe when <hi>goods increaſe, they are increaſed who eat them, Eccleſ.</hi> 5.11. When the enemies are put to flight, and <hi>plenty, peace,</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> returns, the Lord promiſes the <hi>fruit</hi> of <hi>plenty, peace,</hi> and <hi>ſafety;</hi> I will have reſpect unto you, and <hi>make you fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and multiply you,</hi> and ye ſhall eat the old ſtore, and bring forth the old becauſe of the new, ver. 10. And theſe are the <hi>temporal bleſsings</hi> and the principal ones; which alſo have their <hi>ſpiritual</hi> contained under them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His <hi>ſpiritual bleſsings</hi> are here only two; but thoſe <hi>inſtar omnium,</hi> as comprehending all the reſt, his <hi>eſtabliſhing of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them;</hi> and <hi>his reſidence and preſence among them, with them, and in them,</hi> as the parallel Scriptures prove, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 37.26, 27. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.3.</p>
               <p>This is Gods method even with Jewes and Gentiles. If ſo great <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God cannot ſo far prevail with us as to keep us in the <hi>way of his Commandements,</hi> but that we will depart from him, he then <hi>hedges in</hi> our way <hi>with thorns, Hoſ.</hi> 2.6. When his <hi>mercies</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not win upon us, then he ſends his <hi>judgements;</hi> when <hi>rewards</hi> will not <hi>perſwade</hi> us, he then <hi>afflicts</hi> us with his <hi>puniſhments.</hi> Yea, if lighter <hi>afflictions</hi> will not move us, he then ſends <hi>heavier.</hi> Which is the purport of this Chapter, from verſe 14 to the 40, and of my Text; which is named once before, ver. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>Herein we have 1. the Lords <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> of his peoples <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and obſtinate oppoſition;</hi> If ye will not for all this <hi>hearken</hi> unto me, but <hi>walk</hi> contrary unto me. 2. The Lords anſwerable <hi>oppoſition</hi> threatned againſt his peoples ſuppoſed diſobedience and <hi>oppoſition,</hi> then will I <hi>walk</hi> contrary unto you alſo in fury.</p>
               <p>Both which will afford us theſe ſeveral points of doctrine.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it is the <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> that <hi>hears</hi> and <hi>ſees.</hi> This inward <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>hearing</hi> therefore is <hi>obeying;</hi> as the holy Ghoſt ſaith, To day if ye will <hi>hear</hi> his voice, harden not your <hi>hearts, Hebr.</hi> 3. For whereas <hi>Cor est terminus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nium actionum ad intrà,</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> is the term of all actions tending inward, no action can be performed aright, unleſs the <hi>heart</hi> be ſuitably affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with it. So that to the due and effectual <hi>hearing</hi> of the Lords voice, there is required a ſoft, <hi>pliable,</hi> and <hi>tender heart,</hi> and humble, meek and yielding ſpirit, ſuch as that was of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.18, 19.</p>
               <p>The Lord may well ſuppoſe, that <hi>his people</hi> will not <hi>hearken</hi> unto him, but give a <hi>deaf ear</hi> to his command to <hi>walk</hi> in his <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, to keep his Commandements and do them,</hi> which is the precept here to be <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>obeyed,</hi> ver. 3. If we ſhall conſider the Lords experience of mans perverſe reaſonings touching the <hi>grace and mercy of God; the delay of his judgements</hi> againſt impenitent ſinners; <hi>hope of impunity; delight in the pleaſures of ſin; the great gain hoped for</hi> by continuance in ſin; and a thouſand ſuch, whereby the man fruſtrates Gods counſel and hardens his own heart againſt the Commandement of God, to his own deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Hence it followes, that the Lord hath his <hi>ſpeaking power,</hi> and his <hi>voice;</hi> and that he <hi>puts forth his voice,</hi> and would have it <hi>heard and obeyed</hi> by his people. This is neceſſary, as <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf could ſay, becauſe the will of God cannot be known unto men, unleſs God by his Oracle reveal it. Hence it is that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the voice is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by the voice we know the thoughts and will, which otherwiſe are hidden in the ſoul. This minde and will God reveals either immediately by his own in-ſpeaking; or by means of thoſe who are his Truch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Interpreters; which comes all to one purpoſe: For the inward in-ſpeaking is Gods Oracle, and they who ſpeak, ought to ſpeak as the Oracles of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. And in this ſenſe it is true, he who heareth you heareth me.</p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:65717:178"/>
               <p>The Lord leaves it to the power, will, and choiſe of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether they will hearken or not, whether they will obey or not obey. So the holy Ghoſt ſaith <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. To day if ye <hi>will hear</hi> his voice, &amp;c. and here in the text, If for all this <hi>ye will not hearken</hi> unto me, &amp;c.

If any man will do his will, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 7.17. Theſe, and many the like Scriptures evidently prove that the Lord having declared his will unto his people, he leaves them in the hand and power of their own counſel, as the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 15.14.</p>
               <p>It is a free and voluntary act to ſin, and to be diſobedient, and harden our hearts againſt the voice and calling of God. And as free and voluntary an act it is through the preventing grace of God to hear the Lords voice, to be willing and obedient.

               <p>All the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God, all the temporal and ſpiritual <hi>bleſsings</hi> tend hereunto.

               <p>Now if we ſhall enquire, we ſhall finde that there is great <hi>reaſon</hi> why the Lord may <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> this poſſibility, that we may <hi>walk at all adventures with him.</hi> We are his <hi>workmanſhip</hi> created unto good works, that we ſhould <hi>walk</hi> in them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10.

               <p>But as we have a <hi>reaſonable ſoul</hi> which ought to be guided by the <hi>minde of God,</hi> ſo we have alſo <hi>vertibile principium</hi> a mutable and changeable principle in our ſoul, our <hi>will,</hi> which is prone in <hi>utram<expan>

                  </gap>, in the <hi>unreaſonable</hi> part of the ſoul, they are eaſily inclined downward by the allurements of their <hi>ſenſible preſent objects;</hi> and as a ſteep deſcent and ſlippery <hi>way</hi> cauſeth oftentimes the <hi>unwary traveller</hi> to make more haſt then good ſpeed: Such and ſo violent is the <hi>attraction and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>preſent ſeeming good</hi> which too often is disjoyned from the <hi>true good;</hi> whereby the rational appetite <hi>the will</hi> and the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelf</hi> is prepoſterouſly brought off to ſide with the <hi>rebellious Rout;</hi> as the <hi>Pilot</hi> in a <hi>storm</hi> leaves the <hi>helm,</hi> and ſuffers the veſſel to be carried by the <hi>violence</hi> of the <hi>winde and weather.</hi>

               <p>All which laid together, and well conſidered may make up a ſufficient <hi>reaſon,</hi> why the only wiſe God ſhould <hi>ſuppoſe it poſsible,</hi> that his people may <hi>walk by chance or at all adventure with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we meet with one objection, that makes all this contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation quite void. For if the <hi>way</hi> of man be not in himſelf, ſo that he hath no power at all to <hi>walk with God,</hi> to what purpoſe does the Lord command us to <hi>walk in his way?</hi> and why does he threaten us for not walking in it? yea, why does he ſuppoſe it poſſible, that we may <hi>walk</hi> otherwiſe then he hath commanded?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith ſo much. O Lord! I know, that the <hi>way</hi> of the man is not in himſelf, it is not in man that <hi>walketh</hi> to direct <hi>his ſteps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no doubt but this Scripture hath a truth in it, and ſomewhat toward that ſenſe wherein its commonly underſtood. For in God we <hi>live and move</hi> and have our being, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. Nor can the man think one <hi>good thought</hi> of himſelf, without the Lord, nor withſtand an <hi>evil.</hi> Yea, without him we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. And it true which the Schoolmen ſay, that the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65717:181"/>works of <hi>grace</hi> which are to eternal life, are not in the power of man without the <hi>inſpiration and help of God.</hi> So <hi>Aquinas; Ideo gratia prevenit, quia non eſt liberum arbitrium ſed potius infun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur ab ipſo Deo.</hi> Grace is therefore ſaid to prevent, becauſe it is not the faculty of reaſon and will (ſo he defines <hi>liberum arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trium,</hi> 1 <hi>part. quaeſt.</hi> 83. <hi>a</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.) but is rather infuſed of God himſelf. For if in <hi>natural</hi> actions we need <hi>divine</hi> direction, how much more in <hi>ſupernatural?</hi> Theſe ſayings and other like are true; but not grounded upon this ſpeech of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For what if this Scripture be not thus to be underſtood? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the holy Word of God is not <hi>tanquam ſcopae diſſolutae;</hi> not <hi>are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ſine calce;</hi> it is not alwayes <hi>incoherent</hi> and without connexion of one part with other, as ſome would have this to be. Whereas if we look well into it, we ſhall finde, that the Prophet having warned Jeruſalem of the diſtreſs coming upon them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.17, 18. he takes upon himſelf the perſon of the Church lamenting the ruine of it, ver. 19, 20. which he demonſtrates from the <hi>cauſes meriting,</hi> ver. 21. and <hi>inflicting,</hi> ver. 22. which yet he denies to be in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars own power,</hi> but in Gods <hi>over-ruling hand,</hi> ver. 23. O Lord! I know, that the <hi>way of that man,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> is not in himſelf. Then followes 1. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio,</hi> his prayer for the Church. <hi>O Lord! correct me;</hi> let thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly chaſtiſement excuſe or prevent my utter deſtruction. 2. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precatio,</hi> which ruine he prayes againſt; <hi>Correct me not in thine anger, leſt thou bring me to nothing.</hi> 3. <hi>Imprecatio;</hi> he prayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Gentiles; Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that know thee not. Which clearly appears to be the meaning of this Scripture, by comparing with it, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 21.18.—24. where the Lord governs <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and directs and turns him from <hi>Rabbah</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> whither he was marching, to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So that the way of <hi>that man was not in himſelf,</hi> it was not in <hi>that man that walked,</hi> to direct his ſteps.</p>
               <p>Good uſe therefore may be made of that Scripture, as hath been ſhewen; but the <hi>History</hi> muſt be maintained, however ſome other <hi>ſenſe</hi> may be couched under it. So that it no way excuſeth any believer, but that he may <hi>walk in the way of of Gods ſtatutes, keep his Commandements and do them,</hi> and ſo, through the grace and mercy of God, live, and <hi>walk with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore diſſemble not with thy God, O man! not tempt him with thy <hi>pretence</hi> of <hi>weakneſs</hi> or <hi>ignorauce,</hi> nor abuſe that Scripture beyond the ſcope of it, to maintain thine habitual ſins under the colour of infirmities.</p>
               <p>One came before the Oracle at <hi>Delphos</hi> to try whether <hi>Apollo</hi> could diſcover his fraud or not. He had under his Cloak, a <hi>live Bird;</hi> and he asked the Oracle, <hi>Utrum vivum proferam, an mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum,</hi>

For ſince the Scripture it ſelf uſeth this <hi>language;</hi> and the only wiſe God condeſcends in this manner of <hi>ſpeech</hi> to ſpeak to us, why ſhould we be ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or doubtful, whether we ſhould ſo <hi>ſpeak</hi> yea or not? Only that conceit be far from us, that we ſhould think any <hi>event for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous</hi> or <hi>caſual</hi> in reſpect of <hi>God;</hi> but that he <hi>foreſees,</hi> and <hi>wiſely diſpoſeth</hi> and <hi>ordereth</hi> all things, which ſeem <hi>fortuitous, caſual,</hi> and <hi>accidental</hi> unto men. But more of this anon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence we may note, that the <hi>Commandements</hi> of God are a <hi>way.</hi> Where, by the <hi>Commandements</hi> of God, we underſtand not only the <hi>Decalogue</hi> or <hi>Ten Commandements,</hi> but as the Scripture uſeth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>Law</hi> largely, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. and often elſewhere, for <hi>divine doctrine,</hi> and the <hi>revelation</hi> of Gods will in his Word. And ſo the <hi>Goſpel</hi> alſo is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a <hi>Way, Acts</hi> 9.2. and often elſewhere. And that</p>
               <p n="3">3. Being a <hi>Way,</hi> it hath divers ſtages, parts, degrees; many ſins to be departed from; many vertues and graces to be walked in; many enemies to be ſubdued.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>walking</hi> with God in the <hi>way</hi> of his <hi>Commandements</hi> in <hi>truth,</hi> and with a <hi>perfect heart,</hi> is the <hi>whole buſineſs</hi> of Gods <hi>people,</hi> and what he requires and expects of them, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.3. Yea, this is the <hi>whole duty of man, Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. Or indeed the <hi>whole man,</hi> as the words import.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Walking</hi> is <hi>Motus progreſsivus,</hi> a progreſſive <hi>motion,</hi> a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi> from grace to grace, from vertue to vertue. It is <hi>Motus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuus,</hi> not <hi>forward</hi> and then <hi>backward</hi> again; that's not <hi>one,</hi> but <hi>divers motions.</hi> Some works there are which being intermitted, all that is done is loſt: And ſuch is our <hi>walking</hi> in Gods <hi>way,</hi> if interrupted and broken off. If the <hi>Nazarite</hi> make himſelf <hi>unclean by the dead, all the dayes that were before,</hi> ſhall <hi>be lost,</hi> becauſe his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was <hi>defiled, Numb.</hi> 6.12. And if a traveller in Gods <hi>way,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65717:182"/>run well</hi> for a time, and then pollute himſelf with <hi>dead works,</hi> all his labour is <hi>loſt,</hi> he muſt <hi>begin again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. It is poſſible for Gods people ſo to <hi>walk,</hi> through the <hi>grace</hi> of God, without whom we can do <hi>nothing,</hi> and through whom we can do <hi>all things, Phil.</hi> 4.13. that they may keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and do them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Its poſſible alſo that Gods people may not walk with God in <hi>truth</hi> and with a <hi>perfect heart;</hi> but that they may <hi>diverſly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, taſually,</hi> and <hi>at all adventures</hi> with God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There is no <hi>antecedent neceſsity</hi> determining us <hi>to walk,</hi> or <hi>not to walk</hi> with God in the way of his Commandements.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Lord takes notice of the frame and diſpoſition of our heart, whether we be with him or againſt him; and if with him, whether with purpoſe of heart, or by chance only.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Hence we have a balaſt for the ſettlement of our fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and doubtful judgements, in this later part of time when ſo many <hi>winds of doctrine blow;</hi> when ſo many wayes lie oppoſite, diſparate, contrary one to other; and we ſee ſo many <hi>walking</hi> in theſe oppoſite, diſparate, and contrary wayes, judging, cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and condemning one another; —<hi>stat, &amp; incertus, qua ſit ſibi, neſcit, eundum.</hi> How ſhall the <hi>unexperienced traveller</hi> do who ſincerely would, but knowes not how to hit upon that <hi>way</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he may <hi>walk with God.</hi> This hath been the caſe of many, and poſſibly may yet be the condition even of ſome of you. It was, it ſeems, the doubt which troubled ſome in the Prophet <hi>Jeremies</hi> dayes. For thus he directs the people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.16. Thus ſaith the Lord, ſtand ye in the <hi>wayes</hi> and ſee, and ask for the <hi>old paths,</hi> where is the <hi>good way,</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> therein, and ye ſhall finde <hi>reſt for your ſouls.</hi> If the Lord point thoſe in <hi>Jeremies</hi> dayes to an <hi>old way,</hi> it muſt be a <hi>very old way</hi> indeed. We muſt look for it among the <hi>paths;</hi> it ſeems, it is not a <hi>broad beaten road:</hi> that <hi>broad way leads to deſtruction.</hi> But we inquire for <hi>Gods way</hi> wherein we may <hi>walk with him to life everlaſting.</hi> Its found among the <hi>paths;</hi> its a <hi>narrow way.</hi> And it ſeems, there are many <hi>narrow wayes,</hi> many <hi>affected and choſen ſtrictneſſes and strait wayes,</hi> which are to be found in every divided judgement. One or other is <hi>ſtrict</hi> and religious <hi>in his own choſen way.</hi> But are they not <hi>paths, narrow paths cut out of the broad way?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our ſearch is for <hi>Gods old way, his old path,</hi> wherein <hi>Enoch</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>walked with God, Gen.</hi> 5.22.24. and <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6.9. But yet we finde not <hi>what that way was.</hi> The Lord himſelf will teach us it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. It is that which <hi>Abraham</hi> our father taught his ſons, to <hi>walk in the way of the Lord, to do juſtice, and judgement.</hi> This is that <hi>old way</hi> wherein <hi>Abraham walked with God,</hi> as himſelf teſtifies of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.5. <hi>Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my Commandements, my ſtatutes, and my lawes.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:65717:182"/>
               <p>All <hi>other wayes</hi> they are of <hi>yeſterday.</hi> But we <hi>walk by faith</hi> you'l ſay: And did not <hi>Abraham</hi> who is the <hi>father of the faithful?</hi> But we <hi>walk in love; and its an old Commandement,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. John.</hi> And did not <hi>Abraham walk in love,</hi> when he <hi>kept the Commandements of God?</hi> How elſe could he <hi>keep them? Exod.</hi> 20.6. they that <hi>love me and keey my Commandements:</hi> and, <hi>faith works by love.</hi> And by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love Abraham walked</hi> with God in his <hi>ſtatutes, kept his Commandements, and did them.</hi> And this is the <hi>way</hi> we enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the <hi>first</hi> we finde commended to us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. and the ſame the laſt, with a bleſſing annexed unto it, <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandements,</hi> that they may have right to the <hi>tree of life,</hi> and may <hi>enter in thorow the gates into the City, Revel.</hi> 22.14.</p>
               <p>Juſtly therefore are they hence <hi>reproved</hi> who walk <hi>by chance with God;</hi> ſometimes very <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>zealous,</hi> and ſometimes again as <hi>cold:</hi> as in a <hi>feveriſh</hi> and <hi>aguiſh</hi> diſtemper, <hi>unevenly</hi> and <hi>inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately,</hi> like their <hi>pulſe.</hi> Yea, <hi>quaſi aliud agentes,</hi> as if the ſervice of God and <hi>walking with him to all well pleaſing,</hi> were a <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>But there is yet another meaning of theſe words; that the Lord ſuppoſeth, its poſſible that his people might attribute the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> which befel them, to <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> not to <hi>God himſelf.</hi> And ſo they ſhould make <hi>Fortune</hi> their god.</p>

               <p>Hence alſo it appears, that the <hi>moſt high God</hi> having in himſelf <hi>eminently and vertually</hi> the whole cauſality and operative powers of all <hi>neceſſary and contingent cauſes,</hi> and the whole <hi>diſpoſing</hi> and <hi>ordering</hi> their <hi>effects and events,</hi> he may moſt reaſonably and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require of <hi>his people,</hi> an immediate, conſtant, and continual dependence upon himſelf in their whole converſation; ſo that their whole <hi>life</hi> ought to be <hi>lived in him,</hi> who is their <hi>life, Deut.</hi> 30.20. All their motions moved on him, who is their centre, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3. All their works wrought in him, <hi>John</hi> 3.21.

               <p>The <hi>reaſon</hi> of this <hi>unfortunate</hi> and croſs dealing of God with his <hi>people,</hi> is evident from his <hi>peoples fortuitous, accidental</hi> and croſſe dealing with their <hi>God.</hi> The terms and conditions of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant broken on the peoples part, by <hi>uneven</hi> and <hi>caſual walking</hi> with their God, require like <hi>walking</hi> of God with them; or at leaſt diſoblige him from his favourable and conſtant <hi>walking</hi> with them, and in them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.12. God is a moſt juſt <hi>Retaliator. Sequitur ſcelestos ultor à tergo Deus:</hi> God followes wicked men going on in their wickedneſs.

               <p>Whence it followeth; 1. That <hi>Gods threatnings are conditional</hi> as well as his <hi>promiſes; If</hi> ye <hi>walk at all adventures</hi> with me, <hi>then</hi> will <hi>I walk at all adventures</hi> with you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord takes notice of his peoples thoughts, intentions, purpoſes, wayes, workes, their outward and inward <hi>walking,</hi> life and converſation; and accordingly he deals with them.</p>

               <p>Hereby are they juſtly <hi>reproved who walk</hi> with God negligently and <hi>caſually,</hi> as if all things came to paſs by <hi>chance and fortune;</hi> though hereby I do not juſtifie thoſe who impute all things to a <hi>fatal neceſsity.</hi> We read <hi>Acts</hi> 17.18. that the <hi>Epicureans</hi> and <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi> encountred <hi>Paul.</hi> And indeed who ever with <hi>purpoſe of heart</hi> cleave to the Lord, and <hi>walk with him</hi> in his <hi>way,</hi> as <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>ſtory</hi> I the rather mention; becauſe I have obſerved it to be the guiſe of men in this City, like that of the <hi>Athenians, Acts</hi> 17.21. to ſpend their time in hearing or telling ſome new thing; and that commonly they entertain relations of this nature under the notion of <hi>novelties,</hi> and think no more of them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by this and like judgements <hi>awakens us,</hi> and reproves our <hi>caſual and accidental walking</hi> with him; that we ſhould <hi>turn</hi> unto him, lay his <hi>judgement to heart,</hi> learn righteouſneſs, and with full purpoſe of heart walk with him.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Stoicks</hi> of our time are not hereby juſtified, who will have all things come to paſs by an <hi>immutable and fatal neceſsity;</hi> as if the <hi>ſeries</hi> and order of cauſes and effects were ſo knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as <hi>links in a chain,</hi> by an unavoidable <hi>deſtiny;</hi> ſo that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Gods people walk or have walked with him, they nor could, nor can walk otherwiſe then they have done or do. No, nor can God himſelf, having bound up himſelf by his own <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi> walk otherwiſe with his <hi>people</hi> then he hath done or doth walk. Surely theſe men conſider not, that the moſt high God, who made man a <hi>noble and free creature,</hi> with power to act or ſuſpend his act, to do this or that, or their contraries, he himſelf reſerved to himſelf the ſame <hi>liberty,</hi> or greater then what he gave to the counterpane of himſelf.</p>
               <p>And ſince all things between God and man are tranſacted by way of <hi>covenant,</hi> the terms and conditions of it, alwayes ſuppoſe <hi>free agents entring into covenant;</hi> and therefore a <hi>poſsibility of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or breaking covenant;</hi> and conſequently reſpective <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>penalties</hi> annexed thereunto.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe, man ſhould be unjuſtly <hi>puniſhed</hi> for that which could not be avoided; or unduly <hi>rewarded</hi> for what could not be done otherwiſe: Yea, there ſhould be, as no <hi>merit,</hi> ſo no <hi>demerit,</hi>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:65717:185"/>no <hi>demerit,</hi> no <hi>ſin,</hi> no <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> Yea, all <hi>perſwaſions</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions,</hi> all counſels, exhortations, dehortations, all promiſes and threatnings, reproofs, admonitions, all commands, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions; in a word, all acts of God upon mans <hi>will,</hi> (which indeed, upon the matter, ſhould be no <hi>will,</hi>) all <hi>Lawes</hi> of God and men ſhould be altogether <hi>null,</hi> and to no purpoſe; or, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to little more, a meer juggle, a meer pageantry of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actions done onely above-board, when indeed there ſhould be no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>But alas! my <hi>heart</hi> condemns me, that I have not <hi>walked ſo evenly, ſo intirely</hi> with my God. I have had many a good <hi>will</hi> and <hi>purpoſe</hi> to <hi>walk</hi> with my God, and ſomewhat or other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes, diverts me and turns me from my <hi>purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet fear not; the Lord with whom thou <hi>walkest,</hi> looks at thy <hi>heart</hi> and good <hi>will,</hi> and how thou art affected toward <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> with him.

If we have forgotten the Name of our God, or ſtretched out our hands unto a ſtrange god, ſhall not God ſearch it out? for he knoweth the <hi>ſecrets of the heart, Pſal.</hi> 44.20, 21. He looks upon the <hi>hands</hi> thorow the <hi>heart.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what we have in the Text, if ye <hi>will not hearken</hi> unto me, but <hi>walk</hi> at all adventures with me, ſpeaking of the <hi>event,</hi> the ſame ver. 21. ye may read ſpoken of the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>affection,</hi>

               <p>If we inquire into the reaſon why Gods Souldiers ſhould be <hi>numbred, viſited,</hi> and <hi>muſtred,</hi> it will appear 1. from conſideration of the Souldiers themſelves. 2. Their <hi>Commander in Chief.</hi> 3. Their <hi>Common deſigne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the firſt of theſe. They are to be <hi>numbred, viſited, and muſtred,</hi> who are able and fit for <hi>war;</hi> as theſe Souldiers in the text are, choiſe <hi>yong men</hi> in the prime of their age, valiant and couragious. Such Souldiers the Lord requires, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.3, 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as theſe are but <hi>few:</hi>
                  <q>Rari quippe boni—Pauperis eſt numerare pecus—</q> 
                  <hi>Gideons</hi> Souldiers, who went to the battle with him, were but 300.</p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:65717:190"/>
               <p n="3">3. But ſuch as theſe, are <hi>excellent</hi> abſolutely, the <hi>Excellent ones, Pſal.</hi> 16.3. and comparatively <hi>more excellent</hi> then others, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And ſuch are highly eſteemed, loved, cared for, <hi>numbred;</hi> as appears by the contrary; as its ſaid of perſons deſpicable and contemned, <hi>Extra numerum eſſe, nullo numero eſſe, nullius eſſe numeri;</hi> Military phraſes implying ſuch as are of no <hi>reckoning,</hi> of no <hi>account,</hi> who ſtand for <hi>Ciphers.</hi> But the Lords Souldiers are all <hi>numbred, viſited, mustred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the Commander in chief. He is the God of <hi>Iſrael; Iſrael</hi> imports ſtrength and prevalency with <hi>God;</hi> and God is the <hi>ſtrength of Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. And therefore his Souldiers ought to be <hi>ſtrong in the Lord,</hi> and in the power of his might, whom he <hi>viſits, takes care of, numbers, and muſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As for their <hi>deſigne,</hi> it is to <hi>fight</hi> with the ſons of <hi>Anak,</hi> the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> the <hi>Amorites,</hi> the <hi>ſeven nations</hi> whoſe iniquities were full, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. And therefore it concern'd them to be <hi>ſtrong and of a good courage,</hi> and to be numbered, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and muſtered in order to that <hi>deſigne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Whence it followes, that the profeſſion of a Souldier is a lawful profeſſion. God himſelf is the <hi>Lord of hoſts.</hi> And he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf here commands the Iſraelites to be muſtred. And ſurely when the Souldiers asked <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, what they ſhould do, if their imployment had been ſimply unlawful, he would not have directed them how to behave themſelves in it, as he did, but would have adviſed them to deſiſt from it, as he did not, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord takes care of his Militia, he will have them viewed, viſited, numbred, and muſtred.</p>
               <p>But it is not my buſineſs to make a Military Oration, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men to the outward warfare, which throughout the whole Old Teſtament, is figurative of the inward. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come to the myſtical underſtanding of theſe words.</p>
               <p>It is a <hi>Martial, a war-like age</hi> all the World over, an age an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to that which they call <hi>Seculum</hi>

For their <hi>fair Helena,</hi> the ſubject and matter of contention, is <hi>Religion. Revel.</hi> 8.10. When the third Angel had ſounded, there fell a great <hi>Star</hi> from Heaven burning as it were a <hi>Lamp;</hi> and it fell upon the third part of the <hi>Rivers,</hi> and upon the <hi>Fountains of Waters;</hi> and the name of the <hi>Star</hi> is called <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood:</hi> and many men dyed of the waters, becauſe they were made <hi>bitter.</hi>

               <p>Bravely reſolved, <hi>Noble Iſraelites!</hi> But would we indeed <hi>ſerve the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> be of his <hi>Militia, enter,</hi> and <hi>liſt</hi> our ſelves in his <hi>Matricula,</hi> his <hi>Military Roll,</hi> as his Souldiers?</p>
               <p n="1">1. All his Souldiers muſt be <hi>Males,</hi> in regard of <hi>dignity, ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>courage. Pharaoh</hi> reaſon'd right, though to a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked purpoſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.9, 10.16.22. The <hi>ſons</hi> of Iſrael are mightier then we; Come on, let us deal wiſely with them, leſt they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, and it come to paſs, that there falleth out any <hi>war,</hi> and they joyn alſo unto our <hi>enemies</hi> and <hi>fight againſt us,</hi> and ſo get them out of the Land. Therefore lay <hi>ſervile works</hi> upon them; <hi>enfeeble</hi> and <hi>abaſe their ſpirits,</hi> and bring them <hi>low.</hi> As for their <hi>off-ſpring,</hi> kill all the <hi>male</hi> children, and ſave the <hi>female</hi> alive. Thus <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> reaſoned, and that rightly: for the <hi>males of Iſrael</hi> are they who moſt annoy the <hi>ſpiritual Egypt,</hi> and are moſt fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the <hi>ſpiritual Canaanites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet is this no prejudice unto, no exemption of the <hi>female ſex</hi> from the ſpiritual warfare. But as there have been <hi>Virago's, Man-like women,</hi> famous for their <hi>Martial</hi> exploits, their ſtout and <hi>maſculine valour,</hi> as <hi>Semiramis, Tomyris,</hi> the whole Nation of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> beſide many other; ſo there have been, are, and muſt be of the ſame <hi>ſex,</hi> women as <hi>valiant</hi> and <hi>able</hi> to <hi>wage the Lords wars.</hi> Ye read of ſuch, <hi>Exod.</hi> 38.8. who <gap reason="foreign">

For there is the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>maſculine</hi> part of the <hi>inward man</hi> in all faithful and holy women, even <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>vigour of minde and life.</hi> Such was in <hi>Sarah, Hebr.</hi> 11.11. and in all the genuine <hi>daughters</hi> of <hi>Sarah</hi> who are not afraid of any amazement, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.

               <p>But as the Chriſtian fortitude is here ſignified by the maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line <hi>Sex,</hi> Chriſts <hi>Souldiers</hi> muſt be <hi>males;</hi> ſo likewiſe by their <hi>age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lords <hi>warriours</hi> muſt be <hi>twenty years old.</hi> This <hi>age</hi> imports the <hi>strength</hi> of the <hi>yong man.</hi> The Lord requires this <hi>age</hi> in a <hi>Souldier</hi> who is to <hi>fight</hi> againſt the <hi>inward and ſpiritual</hi> enemies?

               <p n="3">3. There is no diſcharge from the ſpiritual warfare, every one
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:65717:192"/>who is liſted in the Army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt be twenty years old and <hi>upward,</hi> or <hi>above.</hi> So old he muſt be, but not only ſo old but <hi>above.</hi> How much above? The Scripture no where limits, no where ſets any period or end to the Chriſtian ſouldiers <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>ſervice.</hi> But more of this anon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Lords Souldier muſt come out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Otherwiſe how can he be ſaid to be redeemed out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> How can he obtain any benefit of his redemption? A <hi>price</hi> indeed is paid for <hi>redemption;</hi> but it profits not them who <hi>continue</hi> in their ſlavery, but thoſe who <hi>come forth</hi> of it, and <hi>ſerve</hi> their Redeemer in his wars. For being redeemed out of the hands of our enemies, we ought to ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him, all the dayes of our life, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. For what is it to <hi>Come?</hi> what elſe but to <hi>believe?</hi> ſo one explains the other, <hi>John</hi> 6.35. Howbeit this <hi>belief</hi> is not, that Chriſt hath come out of <hi>Egypt</hi> for us; not that we ſhould <hi>believe</hi> this, and ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in <hi>Egypt.</hi> The people believed the Lord and his ſervant <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Exod.</hi> 14.31. but the people themſelves came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo muſt we. To <hi>believe</hi> is expreſſed by <hi>coming;</hi> and to be <hi>coming</hi> is to be <hi>yielding, pliable,</hi> and <hi>obedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Here is a great difference between the outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſouldiery. Old age, as of ſixty years, exempts men from going to war, and ſome of the Jews have ſo limited the time, but without warrant of Scripture. For hereby was figured the Chriſtian warfare, from which no man can be <hi>diſcharged,</hi> no man can be <hi>relieved. Paul</hi> the <hi>aged</hi> was alſo a <hi>ſervant</hi> and <hi>ſouldier</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Nor can ſickneſs excuſe us from this warfare, as it doth from the outward. The <hi>Egyptian</hi> was left behinde, becauſe he was ſick, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.13. But too many who in time of health and ſtrength and welfare being called to the ſpiritual <hi>warfare,</hi> would not hear, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.21. the ſame being <hi>preſſed</hi> by ſickneſs and old age, they then begin to learn the uſe of their ſpiritual <hi>arms,</hi> to <hi>repent, deny themſelves,</hi> mortifie their luſts, their <hi>youthful luſts,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22. as of ſurfeting and drukenneſs, which follow them to their <hi>old age,</hi> the <hi>iniquity of their heels, Pſal.</hi> 49.5. which dogs them to their graves; and now they would part with it, when they can enjoy it no longer. Tis true, better late then never: But I much fear, it will be then too late. For the Captain of our ſalvation calls us to this <hi>duty,</hi> ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; For many, I ſay unto you, ſhall ſeek to enter and ſhall not be able, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Howbeit the Lord would not that any of his ſouldiers ſhould diſpair or be diſcouraged, and therefore he ſaith <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Lord accepts of ſuch an one, according to the <hi>time, ſincerity,</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> of his endeavours. He would not that a <hi>good thought</hi> or <hi>will</hi> ſhould be loſt, but accepts it for the <hi>deed</hi> when God himſelf is the cauſe why the <hi>deed</hi> cannot be done. <hi>Completa voluntas pro facto aeſtimatur,</hi> a <hi>complete will,</hi> accompanied with our utmoſt diligence, is eſteemed for the <hi>deed it ſelf.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>What is here turn'd, <hi>whom he conſecrated,</hi> is word for word in the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

So the Spaniſh Bible, <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> tranſlation, and <hi>Piſcators,</hi> and three Low Dutch, and <hi>Coverdale, Ainſworth,</hi> and another old Engliſh tranſlations; all which render the words, <hi>whoſe hand he filled.</hi> The LXX have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whom they conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated their hands. Harſh. <hi>Hierom, Quorum repletae &amp; conſecratae manus,</hi> whoſe hands were filled and (that is) conſecrated: And this laſt the moſt of the other Latin &amp; Engliſh tranſlations follow.</p>
               <p>By filling the hand, ſome here underſtand <hi>Oleo conſecrare,</hi> to <hi>conſecrate with oyl.</hi> But in regard of <hi>oyl,</hi> it were more proper to fill the <hi>Head, on which the oyl was poured,</hi> then the hand; ſince only the Thumb of the Prieſt, and that of the right hand only, was anointed; and that with <hi>blood,</hi> not with <hi>oyl,</hi> as appeares, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.20.</p>
               <p>Others have conceived, that by <hi>filling of the hand,</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Prieſts taking ſomewhat in their hands to offer: and this they prove by <hi>Jeroboams conſecration</hi> of Prieſts, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.33. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.9. Whoſoever cometh to <hi>fill his hand</hi> with a Bullock and ſeven Rams, he ſhall be a Prieſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the no-gods. But this is a very weak proof, to ſay no worſe of it; eſpecially ſince the Scripture ſaith expreſly, This thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſin to the houſe of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> even to the cutting it off, and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65717:199"/>to deſtroy it from off the face of the earth, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.33, 34. That therefore we may know whats here meant by <hi>filling of the Prieſts hand,</hi> let us inquire 1. With what the Prieſts <hi>band was filled.</hi> And 2. who <hi>filled it.</hi> The hand of the Prieſt was <hi>filled</hi> with the Oblations and Sacrifices to be offered up unto God. What thoſe Oblations and Sacrifices were, we ſhall beſt learn out of the firſt <hi>institution</hi> and <hi>conſecration</hi> of the Prieſts, which ye read of, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.9. Where, after the clothing of them, follows this command of the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Thou ſhalt <hi>conſecrate Aaron</hi> and his ſons, the words are the ſame with thoſe in this Text, <hi>Thou ſhalt fill the hand</hi> of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons. With what? That we read at large, together with the rite of <hi>conſecration, ver.</hi> 22, 23, 24, 25. Thou ſhalt take of the Ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, &amp;c. And thou ſhalt <hi>put all in the hands</hi> of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and in the <hi>hands</hi> of his ſons, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But who here <hi>filled the hand</hi> of the Prieſts? Here is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the text; ſome ſay <hi>Aaron.</hi> And <hi>Vatablus</hi> ſupplies his name in the margent. But <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>conſecrated Aaron,</hi> and his ſons; and the Spaniſh Bible puts in the marg. <hi>Moſes,</hi> according to <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.9. <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 45.18. And therefore if either of their names be to be ſupplied, ſurely 'tis rather the name of <hi>Moſes</hi> then that of <hi>Aaron.</hi> But whether it were <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Aaron,</hi> it was no doubt at Gods command; and therefore <hi>Piſcator</hi> in his High Dutch hath <hi>Deren hand der Herr gefullet hatte,</hi> whoſe <hi>hand the Lord hath filled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of this, appears 1. From the conſideration of the Prieſts office. For ſince every high Prieſt is ordained to offer gifts and Sacrifices, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.3. theſe muſt have ſomething to offer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No man might aſſume this power unto himſelf, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.4. but he who is called of God, whoſe <hi>hand the Lord filleth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mysticè.</hi> What is meant by the <hi>hand? Manus eſt animae virtus quâ tenere aliquid &amp; conſtringere quis poteſt, velut ſi dicamus, actus ejus &amp; fortitudo.</hi> The <hi>hand</hi> is the <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of the ſoul, whereby we may apprehend ſomething, &amp;c. It is the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> proceeding from inward power and ſtrength. Thus to have ſomething given into our <hi>hand,</hi> that is into our power. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaith to <hi>Sarah,</hi> Thy Maid is in thy hand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.6. that is, in thy power. For ſo it followes, Do to her what is good in thine eyes. <hi>Num.</hi> 21.2. If thou wilt indeed deliver this people <hi>into my hand;</hi> that is, into my <hi>power,</hi> as it followes, then I will utterly deſtroy their Cities.

And the like may be ſaid of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Who puts all theſe in the Prieſts hand? who elſe but the great God, as was ſhewen before. He puts in the mans power to do good or to do evil.</p>
               <p>Take notice from hence, what the Wiſeman ſaith, <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 15.14. God himſelf made man from the beginning, and left him <hi>in the hand of his</hi> counſel, (the <hi>good and evil is put into thy power</hi>) <hi>if thou wilt,</hi> to keep the Commandements of God, and to perform ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable faithfulneſs: He hath ſet <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>water</hi> before thee; <hi>Stretch forth thine hand to whether thou wilt.</hi> Before man, is <hi>life and death, and whether him liketh,</hi> ſhall be given him. This however Apocryphal, hath prime Canonical Scripture to confirm it with a witneſs. I call Heaven and Earth to record this day againſt you that I have ſet before you life and death, bleſſing and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; therefore chooſe life, that thou and thy ſeed may live; that thou mayeſt love the Lord thy God, and mayeſt obey his voice, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.15.19, 20. And I beſeech you take notice how the Angel in <hi>Eſdras</hi> interprets that place, having ſpoken of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Angel, 2 <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 7.1.—58. then ver. 59. the Angel ſaith, This is the life whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake unto the people, while he lived, ſaying, chooſe thee life, that thou mayeſt live. God puts the good, in ſpecial, into our hand.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>to fill the hand</hi> is to give poſſeſſion of the heavenly goods, whereof God hath made Chriſt the high Prieſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.11. and put all things into his hand; and he makes his believers ſuch when he gives them an earneſt of the holy Land. As when poſſeſſion is given, a clod of the land is given into his hand who takes poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.14.</p>
               <p>Note from hence, who is the great <hi>high Prieſt of our profeſsion;</hi> who elſe but the Son of God? <hi>John</hi> 3.35. The Father loved the Son, and hath <hi>given all things into his hand:</hi> his <hi>right hand is full of righteouſneſs, Pſal.</hi> 48.10.</p>

               <p>Here is no man named, neither <hi>Moſes</hi> nor <hi>Aaron</hi> who fils the hand of the Prieſts; it is the Lord alone who makes Prieſts.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo we learn, what manner of men the <hi>Evangelical Prieſts</hi> ought to be, <hi>Clean-handed men, Man us habere conſummatns,</hi> as one of the Ancients ſpeaks, to have <hi>perfect hands.</hi> Hear what <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> ſpeaks to this purpoſe; God requires of a Prieſt, firſt of all, a good minde, holy and exerciſed in piety; then a life ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with good works, that when he <hi>layes</hi> his <hi>hands on any,</hi> he may ſay with a free conſcience, <hi>Thoſe hands</hi> are neither <hi>corrupted with bribes, nor polluted with innocent blood; they have done hurt, injury, wounds, violence, to no man;</hi> they have not been inſtruments unto any diſhoneſt thing, but have been imployed in things honeſt and profitable, ſuch as are approved by juſt, honeſt, and wiſe men.

               <p>Nor yet do I here confine the <hi>gifts</hi> of God, unto mans <hi>approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>ordination.</hi> Surely the Lord may <hi>fill whoſe hand he will, ſpeak by whom he will;</hi> as he is ſaid to ſpeak, not only by the <hi>mouth,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 1.16. &amp; 3.18. but alſo by the <hi>hand of his Prophets;</hi> as by the <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 4.37. by the <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>Abijah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.15. and many the like, which our Tranſlators render only <hi>[by,]</hi> as <hi>Haggai</hi> 1.1. and often elſewhere.</p>

               <p>For certainly it is unreaſonable, and moſt preſumptuous to confine the Spirit of God unto certain <hi>Theſes, Articles,</hi> confeſſions, and opinions of <hi>mens making,</hi> which yet ſeems ſo much the more daring, and indeed provoking of the only wiſe God, in that they cannot ſay, that their <hi>dictates</hi> proceed from an <hi>infallible ſpirit;</hi> yet would they limit and bound the <hi>infallible Spirit of the God of truth,</hi> by their <hi>preſumptuous humane ſpirit,</hi> which, as they themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, is <hi>fallible</hi> and ſubject unto errour. This, where-ever it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, its the ſpirit of Antichriſt, according to which, the Scribes and Phariſees boldly examined our Lord himſelf, <hi>By what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doeſt thou theſe things, and who gave thee this authority?</hi> And as they dealt with our Lord himſelf, ſo likewiſe with his Apoſtles, as it is evident in their Acts often.

               </p>
               <p>Which yet ſeems the more ſtrange, that the ſame men who have heretofore judged it <hi>most unjust</hi> ſo to have <hi>their hands bound,</hi> &amp; their <hi>mouthes ſtopt,</hi> that they might not <hi>exerciſe their gifts</hi> (their own complaint, and phraſe) the <hi>ſame men</hi> or of the ſame ſpirit are the moſt zealous perſecutors of others, and that upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame grounds: whereby they juſtifie the leaſt warrantable

               <p>Be we exhorted, who ever are made <hi>Prieſts</hi> unto God, that we become like unto the great high Prieſt, who <hi>fills our hand</hi> and makes us Prieſts unto his Father. He is ſtyled by the Apoſtle a merciful and faithful high Prieſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.17.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Mercy,</hi> it is 1. The common <hi>Character</hi> of all who feat God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.4. 2. It is his <hi>command</hi> whoſe Prieſts we are, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.9. 3. He gives <hi>example</hi> in himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.36. and 15.20. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.6. 4. As this mercy is not without <hi>example,</hi> ſo not without <hi>reward, Prov.</hi> 14.21. He who hath mercy on the poor,<note place="margin">Prov. <hi>14.</hi> Ver. <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note> happy is he. Or rather, O the bleſſedneſs of him, who hath <hi>mercy</hi> on the poor! Bleſſed are the <hi>merciful</hi> for they ſhall obtain mercy. 5. It is more acceptable unto the Lord then Sacrifie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.12. and 12.27. Its the primary will of God, whereas the other is the ſecondary, leſs principal, and good only in order to the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the great <hi>high Prieſt</hi> is <hi>merciful unto men,</hi> ſo is he <hi>faithful unto God</hi> in things belonging unto God. The <hi>Father hath given all things into his hand, John</hi> 3.35. And he was <hi>faithful</hi> unto him who appointed him, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.2. which was neceſſary in regard of the covenant between the Father and the Son, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 40.6, 7, 8. which the Apoſtle applies, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.5.—9.</p>
               <p>And as the great <hi>high Prieſt</hi> was <hi>faithful,</hi> ſo ought we to be in things belonging to God, in our <hi>Prieſts office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have many kindes of <hi>Oblations to offer unto our God,</hi> which the great <hi>high Prieſt hath put into our hand.</hi> Every Prieſt muſt have ſomewhat to <hi>offer.</hi> And I fear, we have many of us too much to <hi>offer.</hi> Have we offered up our free-will offering? <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. Our <hi>treſpaſs-offering, Pſal.</hi> 51. Our daily whole burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.22. The Wiſeman tels us of many <hi>Oblations, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſ.</hi> 35.1. &amp;c. Theſe are the moſt acceptable <hi>Sacrifices</hi> when the Prieſt offers, not <hi>alienam carnem, at ſuam mactat voluntatem,</hi> not the <hi>fleſh of beaſts,</hi> but <hi>his own will.</hi> For the inward <hi>offerings</hi> are moſt pleaſing unto our God, who is a <hi>ſpirit;</hi> when we mortifie, kill, and crucifie our <hi>corrupt affections and luſts,</hi> which are contrary to the law and will of God. So that he who <hi>keeps the Law, offers Sacrifices</hi> enough, ſaith the Wiſe man, <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>Such are all acts conformable to the <hi>will</hi> of God, all acts of <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to the <hi>law</hi> of God, which the high Prieſt hath <hi>put into our hand and power,</hi> and enabled us to do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. It is the ſaying of an holy Father, <hi>Verum ſacrificium eſt omne bonum opus quod agitur, ut ſanctâ ſocietate Deo inhaereamus, &amp;c.</hi> A true Sacrifice is every good work which is performed, that with holy fellowſhip, we may cleave unto God.</p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:65717:202"/>
               <p>And doubtleſs it is the will of God, and which was at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by him, that ſuch a <hi>Prieſthood</hi> ſhould be the common <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of all his faithful and obedient people. And therefore, upon <hi>condition of obedience,</hi> the Lord makes promiſe to all Iſrael, that they ſhall be unto him a <hi>kingdom of Prieſts, Exod.</hi> 19.6. And this promiſe no doubt had been fulfilled, had they continued in their <hi>obedience:</hi> But when they fell by <hi>idolatry, Exod.</hi> 32. upon occaſion hereof, God made choiſe of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> who according to their name, <hi>clave</hi> intirely to the Lord, when all the other Tribes revolted.</p>
               <p>Yea, and upon the diſobedience of <hi>Levi,</hi> the Lord ſaith, he will have <hi>no pleaſure</hi> in them, nor will receive <hi>an offering at their hand, Mal.</hi> 1.10. but that his Name ſhall be great among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> ver. 11. And Chap. 2. Becauſe the <hi>Prieſts corrupted the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Levi,</hi> and they made the people <hi>ſtumble at the law,</hi> (which hath been and is the great ſin of the preſent <hi>Prieſthood</hi>) therefore hath the Lord rendred them contemptible and baſe before all the people; where their crime is again repeated, ver. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo it is, that the Lord threatneth, that he will cut off the name of the <hi>Chemarim</hi> with the Prieſts, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.4. Therefore the promiſe of the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> is <hi>enlarged,</hi> even to all the penitent believers and obedient ones; and is ſaid to be fulfilled, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p>O that the ſame Prieſts office were fulfilled by us! into whoſe <hi>hand and power</hi> the Lord puts ſuch ſpiritual <hi>ſacrifices,</hi> as ſhall be accepted of God, through Jeſus Chriſt the great <hi>high Priest.</hi> By him therefore let us offer up the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of praiſe to God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, that is,<note place="margin">Hebr. <hi>13.</hi> Ver. <hi>15, 16</hi>

               <p>Which are not to be conſidered only in themſelves, but as they refer us to things far better then themſelves; whereof they were only types and examples: and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> had a charge to make all things according to the <hi>patern</hi> ſhewed him in the Mount, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.40. which he exactly performed, Chap. 39.42, 43.

               <p>The reaſon why the <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>holy things</hi> are <hi>ſwallowed</hi> up and <hi>devoured,</hi> may be underſtood from the conſideration of Satan and his miniſters their envie againſt the <hi>holineſs</hi> of God and his <hi>holy ones,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.

               </p>
               <p>This ſenſe is warranted by the fifteenth verſe of this fourth Chapter, where <hi>Moſes</hi> uſeth <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The <hi>holineſs</hi> or <hi>holy things</hi> are <hi>covered</hi> and <hi>hid from us</hi> by two kindes of <hi>vailes;</hi> whereof one upon the <hi>object</hi> or <hi>holy things</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the other upon us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>vailes</hi> upon the objects <hi>holineſs</hi> or <hi>holy things</hi> themſelves, are the ceremonial ſervices in types and figures.

For as in the body of man, the moſt tender &amp; pretious part is covered by a <hi>ſoft</hi> one, as a <hi>ſilm,</hi> and that by ſome <hi>harder</hi> and ſtronger part; as the <hi>ſight of the eye,</hi> by the tunicles; the brain by the <hi>pia mater,</hi> that by the <hi>meninx</hi> and <hi>dur a mater:</hi> So have the <hi>holy things</hi> of God their next, inward, and ſubtil <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,</hi> as <hi>ridles, parables, and numbers;</hi> and theſe more ſenſible and outward, as the outward <hi>coverings</hi> of the <hi>worldy Sanctuary, Hebr.</hi> 9.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Other <hi>vailes</hi> there are upon us, whereby the <hi>holy things</hi> are <hi>hidden</hi> from us. And theſe are either 1. As it were <hi>innate</hi> and <hi>inbred,</hi> according to which the Apoſtle ſaith, that <gap reason="foreign">

Or 2. there are <hi>vailes acquiſite</hi> and of our own making; and theſe are of two ſorts, whereof the one, we draw or ſuffer to be impoſed and drawn upon our <hi>mindes;</hi> the other upon our <hi>hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That which is drawn upon our <hi>mindes</hi> is the <hi>vail of knowledge falſly ſo called;</hi> a <hi>vail</hi> of falſe notions and miſunderſtandings of ſpiritual things, ſaith <hi>S.

Their names ſignifie <hi>covering;</hi> and accordingly the Spirit of God makes uſe of them. Thou ſhalt be like a <hi>cloud to cover</hi> the land.

He would be taken for the <hi>true light,</hi> for <hi>God himſelf;</hi> and takes up his place in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, the mindes and hearts of men. This the Apoſtle cals the myſterie of iniquity, and the deceiveableneſs of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. And ſo it is indeed, when <hi>iniquity</hi> it ſelf is taken for <hi>righteouſneſs it ſelf;</hi> when <hi>erroneous opinions</hi> are taken for the <hi>truth</hi> it ſelf; when groſs <hi>ignorance</hi> is taken for <hi>true knowledge;</hi> when palpable <hi>darkneſs</hi> is taken for the <hi>light</hi> it ſelf. A <hi>mystery of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> a ſtrong deluſion, when men are brought to believe a <hi>lie</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the <hi>truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe <hi>coverings</hi> are patcht together with great artifice by the ſubtilty of the old Serpent, which, to <hi>hide</hi> and defend himſelf, hath found out a world of diſtinctions, without any ground of them in the Word of God; as the <hi>Sepia,</hi> to eſcape the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and preſerve her ſelf, caſts forth a filthy black liquor, ſaith <hi>Aelian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon why the <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>holy things</hi> are <hi>covered,</hi> may be conſidered either in regard of the <hi>things themſelves,</hi> which are <hi>covered,</hi> or in reſpect of the <hi>perſons</hi> whether he be <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thoſe to whom the holy things are <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered</hi> and <hi>revealed.</hi> 1. As for the <hi>holy things</hi> themſelves, there is a kinde of neceſſity, that they ſhould be <hi>concealed;</hi> becauſe they have no name of their own, nor ſenſible figure, nor any outward ſemblance proper to themſelves, ſaith <hi>Dionyſius Areop.</hi> all which they muſt borrow from things known to us if we muſt know them. So that the reaſon why the <hi>holy things</hi> are inveloped and hidden, is <hi>è neceſsitate materiae,</hi> as the Philoſpher ſpeaks of the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:65717:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>hair, though in ſomewhat a different ſenſe, it proceeds from the neceſſity of the matter it ſelf. But further, as the hair is alſo a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the woman, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.15. (though effeminate &amp; womaniſh men have robd them of that ornament) ſo it is for the <hi>excellency</hi> &amp; <hi>glory</hi> of divine truths, that they be ſo hidden in myſteries. Nature hath concealed her <hi>treaſures</hi> from open view: for tis from the worth of gold and ſilver, that they are <hi>hidden</hi> under the barren earth; and from the worth of the <hi>kingdom of heaven,</hi> that is, a <hi>treaſure hidden</hi> in the field, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. Thus <hi>Pearls</hi> are hidden in <hi>ſhells</hi> and under water. And the <hi>kingdom of heaven</hi> is a <hi>goodly Pearl,</hi> a <hi>treaſure,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>2</hi> Cor. <hi>4.</hi> ver. <hi>7.</hi>

               <p>But that is a needleſs and ſuperfluous ornament, that beſide adorning is for no other uſe. And therefore as the hair is a <hi>glory</hi> to the woman, ſo it is given unto her as a <hi>neceſſary covering.</hi> Ye know, pretious <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Jewels</hi> are wont to be kept and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from hand to hand, not nakedly and openly, but in <hi>Cabinets</hi> and <hi>Caskets,</hi> or other coverings. And this is the moſt profitable and pleaſing way of conveying theſe <hi>pretious Jewels,</hi> theſe <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treaſures</hi> of divine truth unto men, ſaith <hi>Aquinas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other reaſons conſiderable in the perſons both revealing myſteries, and thſe to whom they are revealed, and from whom they are hidden, will be more properly and ſeaſonably alleaged for the proof of the following points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence we learn the object, ground, and matter of all or moſt <hi>controverſies</hi> in the Church of God. The <hi>holy things</hi> of God are <hi>covered.</hi> For men differ not in opinion touching <hi>things openly known:</hi> For who but a mad man or ſtark blinde would diſpute, whether it were <hi>day</hi> or not, when the <hi>Sun ſhines</hi> forth bright and clear at <hi>high noon?</hi> Some divine truths there are as <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> as the <hi>Sun ſhines,</hi> ſo that no queſtion can be made of them: they give <hi>teſtimony of themſelves,</hi> and need no other argument to <hi>prove</hi> then to be. Theſe prevent all <hi>controverſies</hi> and <hi>ſtrivings</hi> of men about them.</p>
               <p>But other divine truths there are <hi>myſtical and hidden;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe and <hi>theſe only,</hi> men <hi>differ;</hi> and hence proceed moſt <hi>controverſies,</hi> which diſtract and divide the Church of Chriſt at this day, Which when we hear, we may well conclude, that the <hi>truths</hi> whereabout they <hi>differ,</hi> are <hi>not known:</hi> For were they <hi>known,</hi> there would be then no further <hi>difference</hi> about them; we will not quarel a <hi>blinde man,</hi> but pity him rather, if he ſay, tis <hi>dark,</hi> when the <hi>Sun ſhines.</hi> Of ſuch as theſe, <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaks, they are
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:65717:207"/>turnd aſide, ſaith he, unto vain <hi>jangling,</hi> deſiring to be teachers of the Law, (yea, and the Goſpel too) <hi>understanding</hi> neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. and 6.20. he rightly calls <hi>controverſies</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of ſcience or knowledge falſly ſo called:</hi> For did they truly <hi>know</hi> the truths whereabout they <hi>contend,</hi> they would not <hi>contend</hi> about them as they do.</p>
               <p>And therefore when <hi>controverſies</hi> are ſtarted and hotly purſued in the Church, its a good rule not to be over-haſty in ſiding and adhering to <hi>ſpirits of contradiction;</hi> but rather to do, as they ſay, tis the ſafeſt courſe for a traveller in a <hi>dark night,</hi> and in danger to be miſlead by the <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> or <hi>fools fire,</hi> to ſit down, and wait upon the heavens for <hi>light.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> preſcribes the ſame courſe for avoyding the like <hi>fools fire</hi> of <hi>contention kindled</hi> by <hi>ignorant and undiſcreet zelots,</hi> Chap. 50.10, 11. Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his ſervant, that walketh in <hi>darkneſs</hi> and hath <hi>no light?</hi> Let him <hi>trust in the Name of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>ſtay upon his God.</hi> Behold all ye who <hi>kindle a fire,</hi> who compaſs your ſelves about with <hi>ſparks,</hi> walk in the <hi>light</hi> of your fire, and in the ſparks that ye have kindled: This ſhall ye have of my hand; ye ſhall lie down in ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture is not ſo <hi>plain, perſpicuous,</hi> and <hi>eaſie,</hi> as ſome conceive it to be. No, no; For though I dare not ſay with <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea, hence it followes, that it is <hi>no diſhonour,</hi> as ſome think it to be, to diſcover a <hi>myſtical, ſpiritual,</hi> and <hi>all egorical ſenſe</hi> of the holy Scriptures, both of the Law and of the Goſpel.

               <p>But this, will ſome ſay, proves a <hi>fatal decree</hi> of <hi>biding</hi> the holy truths of God from ſome, and <hi>revealing</hi> them to others. As our Lord ſeems to ſay expreſly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.11. To <hi>you it is given</hi> to know the <hi>myſtery</hi> of the kingdom of God, but to <hi>them it is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Holy <hi>Chryſoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Chriſt ſpeaks thus, ſaith that holy Father, not as if he meant to bring in any <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity</hi> or <hi>fatality</hi> into the world, no, nor <hi>chance</hi> and <hi>caſualty,</hi> but that he might ſhew, that <hi>evil men</hi> are the cauſe of their own <hi>evils,</hi> and that the knowledge of divine <hi>myſteries</hi> is the <hi>gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this ſeems hard meaſure, and at leaſt an unkinde <hi>excluſion</hi> of the <hi>Kohathites,</hi> men in their <hi>natural eſtate,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>under the Law,</hi> that they ſhould not be admitted to ſee the <hi>boly things.</hi> Not ſo; for God is the God of order; and in all ages the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>legal ſervices,</hi> and the <hi>Ministers of the Law</hi> are in order to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> according to the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. unto whom it was revealed that not unto <hi>themſelves,</hi> but unto <hi>us,</hi> they did <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the things</hi> which are now reported unto you, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Beſides, although they know not the <hi>ſecrets</hi> and <hi>holy things</hi> of God, yet ſome things are ſo plain that they cannot but know them, which God hath imparted indifferently to all. Thus when the Scribes of <hi>Eſdras</hi> had written 204 books, the Higheſt ſpake thus unto him; The <hi>firſt</hi> that thou haſt written, <hi>publiſh openly,</hi> that the <hi>worthy</hi> and <hi>unworthy</hi> may read; but keep the Seventy <hi>laſt,</hi> that thou mayeſt deliver them only to <hi>ſuch as be wiſe among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> For in them is the Spring of underſtanding, the Fountain of wiſdom, and the Light or ſtream of knowledge, 2 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 14.45, 46, 47.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Kohathites,</hi> men in their <hi>natural condition, ſtupidity,</hi> and <hi>dulneſs,</hi> yea, men under the Law, muſt not <hi>go in to ſee</hi> the <hi>holineſs</hi> or <hi>holy things,</hi> then ſurely men <hi>under ſin</hi> &amp; dominion of fin, ought not to go in to ſee them. Theſe are <hi>excluſiſsimi</hi> of all other moſt excluded. They are without the <hi>fold</hi> of Chriſt, and therefore not of his <hi>ſheep;</hi> nor do they <hi>hear his voice,</hi> nor <hi>know him, John</hi> 10. who is the <hi>wiſdom and holineſs of holineſſes, Dan.</hi> 9.24. They are not of the <hi>houſhold</hi> of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. but without the <hi>houſe,</hi> where Chriſt
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:65717:209"/>expounds <hi>myſteries</hi> to his Diſciples, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.34. and 9.28. and 10.10. There is a wall round about Gods <hi>houſe</hi> to make a ſe paration between the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> and the <hi>prophane place,</hi> wherein they are who are without, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 42.20. They are without the <hi>City</hi> of God, aliens from the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſtrangers and foreiners, not fellow <hi>Citizens with the Saints,</hi> among whom God reveals his myſteries, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. They are without the <hi>kingdom</hi> of God, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> unto Chriſt, ſuch as will not that he ſhould reign over them, or ſhould be other then a Prieſt, and he ſuch an one as they feign him to be, by whom they may <hi>imagine-away their ſins;</hi> they will by no means admit him as a King who may bear rule, and reign over them. Now <hi>mysteries</hi> of State myſteries of a <hi>Kingdom</hi> are not revealed to <hi>Strangers,</hi> much leſs to <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>Rebels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it appears, that there are <hi>degrees of holy things,</hi> as alſo of <hi>holy perſons</hi> who may approach unto them, as alſo of the <hi>ſpiritual ſight</hi> and knowledge of them.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>holy things</hi> ſome were <hi>within the vail,</hi> and in the <hi>moſt holy,</hi> others were <hi>without the vail.</hi> Accordingly there are ſome <hi>great myſteries,</hi> as that of <hi>union</hi> with God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>great myſtery, Epheſ.</hi> 5.32. Theſe are called <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Proportionably to theſe two kindes of <hi>holy things</hi> there were two <hi>degrees of holy perſons.</hi> 1. <hi>The high Prieſt</hi> who alone might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the <hi>moſt holy</hi> only once a year, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Hebrews</hi> 9.7. 2. The <hi>Prieſts of the ſecond order</hi> might enter and approach and ſee the <hi>holy things without the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly there are <hi>degrees of holy perſons:</hi> whereof ſome are <hi>yong</hi> and weak,<note place="margin">Hebr. <hi>5.</hi> ver. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> and of little underſtanding <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, unskilful, or rather, according to the margent, <hi>having no experience</hi> in the word of righteouſneſs, for they are babes. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which are oppoſed <hi>perfect men,</hi> in the next words, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.13, 14. the <hi>perfect men,</hi>

                     <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>2.</hi> ver. <hi>6.</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>in perfect men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p>Yet there reſts one main doubt. For whereas the holy things are here ſaid to be <hi>covered</hi> and <hi>hid</hi> from men in their <hi>animaliſh</hi> condition, and from thoſe <hi>under the law,</hi> and yet much more from <hi>wicked men,</hi> who, of all other, are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>excluſiſsimi</hi> moſt of all excluded from the <hi>ſight</hi> of the <hi>holy things;</hi> yet we read of many <hi>wicked men,</hi> falſe Prophets, falſe Apoſtles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who have <hi>ſeen</hi> far into the <hi>ſecret things</hi> of God, to whom many <hi>Myſteries</hi> have been <hi>revealed:</hi> And many ſuch <hi>Seers</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Saints there are at this day, <hi>Qui curios ſimulant &amp; Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia vivunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:65717:209"/>
               <p>It is very true. Yet we muſt underſtand a difference of <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> and men to whom they are revealed. For <hi>revelations</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proportioned unto the diverſe receptivities and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men; whereof ſome are fitted unto <hi>ſenſe,</hi> others to the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> others above the natural reach of both: men of ordinary capacity, who buſie not themſelves much with divine truth, may attain unto the firſt kinde; of which ſort was <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> dreams. But the ſecond ſort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a more ſublime and ſubtil <hi>understanding</hi> which alſo hath a <hi>genius</hi> of <hi>divining</hi> in it. And into ſuch <hi>underſtandings</hi> ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths may glide, as a ſound into the <hi>ear,</hi> or a light into the <hi>eye,</hi> without our chooſing either to <hi>ſee</hi> or <hi>hear.</hi> And ſuch were <hi>Balaams</hi> viſions and <hi>revelations</hi> concerning Chriſt. He <hi>heard</hi> the words of God, and <hi>ſaw</hi> the <hi>viſions</hi> of the Almighty, having his <hi>eyes</hi> open, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.4. Both theſe may befal all men alike with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difference of good and bad, ſince <hi>revelation</hi> abſtractly taken is terminated upon the <hi>apprehenſive faculties,</hi> and reſpects pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the <hi>ſenſe, imagination,</hi> and <hi>underſtanding,</hi> according to none of which, a man is ſaid to be <hi>morally good or bad,</hi> but according to the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> the beſt habit of it. So that it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that the <hi>ſenſe, fanſie,</hi> and <hi>underſtanding</hi> of fleſh and blood may <hi>know</hi> and <hi>pry far</hi> and <hi>reveal</hi> much of divine truth; yea, <hi>ſee farther</hi> then ſome others who are <hi>ſpiritually minded.</hi> Thus <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> ſaw it was neceſſary, that Chriſt ſhould die, which <hi>S. Peter</hi> himſelf <hi>ſaw not.</hi> Yet are theſe ſaid not to <hi>know</hi> them nor <hi>reveal</hi> them; becauſe neither <hi>extenſively</hi> according to the latitude of the <hi>object,</hi> nor <hi>intenſively</hi> according to the due and thorow <hi>perfection</hi> of the act.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not <hi>extenſively,</hi> becauſe there is yet a <hi>vail</hi> and <hi>covering</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>object</hi> which they <hi>ſee:</hi> ſo that albeit they <hi>ſee</hi> far into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine matters, yet not unto the <hi>end</hi> of the things they <hi>ſee,</hi> faith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. their <hi>ſight</hi> is bounded with a <hi>ſhadow, Col.</hi> 2.18. So that <hi>ſeeing</hi> they <hi>ſee</hi> not; ſomewhat they <hi>ſee,</hi> that's true, yet they <hi>ſee</hi> not the utmoſt <hi>truth</hi> of what they <hi>ſee.</hi> For who more skilful in the <hi>letter</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Law,</hi> then the Scribes and Phariſees were? yet they believed not in <hi>Moſes Law,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, and proves it, becauſe they <hi>believed not in him</hi> who is the <hi>and of the Law.</hi> They deſire to be teachers of the law, ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> not what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as they fail in <hi>extent</hi> of the <hi>object,</hi> ſo in the <hi>intenſiveneſs</hi> of the act. For there muſt be not only <hi>Urim,</hi> but <hi>Thummim</hi> alſo in the breaſt-plate: not <hi>illumination</hi> only, but <hi>integrity</hi> of life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in him who truly <hi>knowes</hi> and <hi>reveals</hi> divine <hi>truth;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>knowledge</hi> in the Scripture notion, is then through and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, when it is terminated upon the <hi>heart;</hi> and <hi>revelation</hi> is then through and perfect, when it proceeds from the <hi>heart.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:65717:210"/>to that true rule; <hi>That the heart is the term of all actions from without, and the fountain of all actions from within,</hi> whether they be words or deeds. Thus the true <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>wiſdom</hi> which is the ground of <hi>revelation,</hi> is <hi>affective</hi> and <hi>experimental</hi> and <hi>effective.</hi> Whence it is that <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries are aſcribed unto the <hi>heart</hi> the <hi>ſeat of the affections.</hi> The <hi>fear</hi> of the Lord is the beginning of <hi>wiſdom;</hi> and men are ſaid to be <hi>wiſe hearted,</hi> or contrarily to have their <hi>fooliſh heart</hi> darkned; and out of the abundance of the <hi>heart</hi> the mouth ſpeaketh. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this notion of <hi>knowledge,</hi> the Lord ſpeaks to <hi>Jehoiakim;</hi> did not the father do <hi>judgement and juſtice,</hi> and judge the cauſe of the poor and needy, and then it was well with him? And was not this to <hi>know</hi> me, ſaith the Lord? <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.15, 16. Such is not the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>revelation</hi> of fleſh and blood: its not <hi>affective</hi> not <hi>experimental;</hi> they have no part of what they <hi>know;</hi> but as Cooks they dreſs meat for others palates; or as Leaden Pipes they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey and derive the water of life thorow them to others, but drink not of it. So Poaſts and Curriers carry <hi>myſteries</hi> of State, but are not privy to them: and as the <hi>Kohathites</hi> bare the ſecret <hi>holy things,</hi> yet <hi>ſaw</hi> them not. Hence it is, that, though the Scribes were the moſt learned of the Jews, yet when they rejected and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the word of the Lord, and would not be <hi>taught</hi> to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, the <hi>Pen of the Scribes was vain,</hi> and there was no <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in them, ſaith the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Chap. 8.9. Yea, though what they <hi>ſaid</hi> was <hi>true,</hi> yet <hi>as they ſaid it,</hi> it was not true. For though they ſay, <hi>the Lord liveth,</hi> they ſwear <hi>falſly</hi> ſaith the ſame Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.1, 2. And therefore our Saviour ſilenced the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil when he <hi>revealed</hi> him. And the reaſon is, <hi>He that names the Lord Jeſus Chriſt muſt depart from iniquity.</hi> For no man can ſay, that <hi>Jeſus is the Lord, but from the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. Thus did <hi>S. John:</hi> That which was from the beginning, which we have <hi>heard,</hi> which we have <hi>ſeen,</hi> which we have <hi>looked</hi> upon, and our hands have <hi>handled</hi> of the word of life: That which we have <hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>beard, declare we unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since therefore what ſpeculative <hi>knowledge</hi> of divine <hi>myſteries wicked men have, doth not make them good,</hi> ſince their <hi>ſight and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of them,</hi> extendeth not unto the true <hi>end,</hi> nor proceeds from the true <hi>beginning,</hi> they may be truly ſaid to <hi>know</hi> and not to <hi>know,</hi> to <hi>ſee</hi> and not to <hi>ſee,</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> and not to <hi>hear;</hi> which in Gods true eſtimate is not at all to <hi>hear, ſee, or know</hi> them. The <hi>Koha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites</hi> bare thoſe <hi>holy things</hi> which they muſt neither touch nor ſee.</p>
               <p>Is not this the condition of many at this day, who, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, deſire to be teachers of the <hi>Law,</hi> and underſtand not what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. Nay, do not many teach the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and preach Chriſt <hi>born, crucified, dead, buried, riſen, aſcending into heaven,</hi> &amp;c. yet underſtand no more then the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:65717:210"/>bare letter of all theſe articles of faith? what underſtand they more of Chriſt, then the <hi>dull Kobathites</hi> did, of the <hi>holy things</hi> which they carried, yet neither toucht nor ſaw them? For what elſe is the <hi>letter covering</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> to theſe, then the many <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> of the <hi>holy things</hi> to the <hi>Kohathites?</hi> They have no ſpiritual, no tactual, no experimental knowledge of the things they ſpeak of. The <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> the <hi>tactual,</hi> the <hi>experimental</hi> knowledge is that whereof <hi>S. John</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf and his fellow Apoſtles, they had heard and ſeen and handled of the word of life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <p>How ſhall we come to <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>know the bolineſs</hi> and <hi>holy things</hi> of our God? Surely this comes not to paſs by any <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, any ſagacity or curious inquiſition of our own. We cannot know the <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>holy things,</hi> unleſs the <hi>holy one</hi> himſelf teach them, and reveal them to us. And this he will do in his due time if we do not hoodwink our ſelves with the black vailes on our mindes and hearts.</p>
               <p>For ſince there is nothing <hi>covered</hi> that ſhall not be <hi>revealed,</hi> nor <hi>hid</hi> that ſhall not be <hi>made known;</hi> ſurely it is not the will of God that his <hi>holineſs of holineſſes</hi> ſhould <hi>alwayes</hi> be <hi>concealed;</hi> nor from <hi>all men;</hi> ſince the <hi>Priests</hi> ſaw them.</p>
               <p>And ſo ſhall we, if we be <hi>Prieſts</hi> unto our God; if we <hi>ſore</hi> not up too high; if we <hi>intrude</hi> not haſtily into the things that we have <hi>not ſeen;</hi> if we exerciſe not our ſelves in things that are too <hi>high</hi> for us; if we behave our ſelves and quiet our ſouls as <hi>children</hi> weaned from their mothers womb, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1, 2. If we climb not up into Gods houſe ſome other way, but can be very well content to enter in by the door, and ſit down in the loweſt room.

               <p>This menace and threatning was really fulfilled upon the <hi>Beth-ſhemites,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19.</p>
               <p>This comes to paſs by the pride and curious ſearching of the earthly man, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18.

For, that a thing is poſſible, does not prove the thing to be. <hi>A potentia ad actum non valet conſequentia.</hi> But if a thing <hi>be,</hi> certainly it is <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> to <hi>be. Ab actu ad potentiam valet conſequentia.</hi> That it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to commit ſome or other of <hi>all the ſins of men,</hi> appears by the manifold examples, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28.—32. And ſuch as <hi>S. Paul</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1.—5. And would God that the examples of theſe ſins did not ſo abound among us to prove the poſſibility!</p>
               <p>Let us inquire into the reaſon of this, why men are ſo <hi>fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent and deceitful,</hi> ſo <hi>violent and miſchievous</hi> one to another, ſo full of cheating, theft, and rapine. Truly we muſt refer the reaſon of this to the principles of <hi>Atheiſm, Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>without God in the world;</hi> or, which is next unto it, <hi>Epicureiſm</hi> excluding divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence from this lower world, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 8.8. and 9.9. when they think that the Lord hath forſaken the earth. Or, which is near to that, <hi>Saduceiſm,</hi> denying rewards and puniſhments after a well or ill lead life. Or, which borders upon that, corrupt principles of falſe Chriſtianity; <hi>That the duties of the Moral Law belong not unto them who are in Chriſt;</hi> as they fanſie themſelves to be. <hi>That
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:65717:213"/>God will ſee no ſin in them. That all things indeed are theirs; and that they who are thought to be the true owners of them, are but intruders and uſurpers. That ſin is unavoidable, and that it is impoſsible to ceaſe from ſin, though by the power of God; yea, by the greateſt power that can be given to man in this life.</hi> That <hi>ſolemn agreements and covenants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man, are but covenants of works:</hi> That <hi>we muſt not hope to be juſtified by our own works; though they proceed from the ſpirit of God, but by faith in Chriſt; That he has been juſt, for us, and done all things that we are commanded to do,</hi> 1600 <hi>years ago, and has ſuffered the puniſhment due to us for our not doing them. That the very beſt works we do, are ſins. That cheating, couſening, deceiving, circumventing, fraudulent dealing, overreaching, of all the ſins that men commit, the very worſt of them are but infirmities in the Saints, what ever they are in other men.</hi> From theſe corrupt principles, and ſuch as theſe, men work, and for one end men work <hi>to be rich in this world;</hi> and by the abuſe of theſe riches, to take their eaſe in their old age, <hi>eat, drink and be merry;</hi> as our Lord diſcovers the rich mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19. So <hi>violent men</hi> argue, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13. <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 2. In like manner the deceived heart is inticed by hope of <hi>ſtoln waters, Prov.</hi> 9.17. <hi>and bread of deceit, Prov.</hi> 20.17.</p>
               <p>So that the true reaſon of all <hi>deceit and violence</hi> and <hi>wrongful dealing among men who pretend religion,</hi> is corruption of doctrine, and, may be referred to it directly and demonſtratively, as to the proper ſource and Fountain of it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 30.10. They ſay to the Seers, ſee not, and to the Prophets propheſie not right things: ſpeak unto us ſmooth things, propheſie deceits, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. the laſt ver.

               <p>But who ſets the falſe Prophets a work? who but the <hi>Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Apollyon,</hi> the deſtroyer, the author of <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>wrong?</hi> who but the ſame ſubtil Serpent who <hi>deceives all the world?

               <p>I ſo the words be to be underſtood, every ſin committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our brother, ſhould be a ſin with an high hand, as intended againſt God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>We muſt know therefore that there is a twofold end: 1. <hi>finis agentis,</hi> and 2. <hi>finis rei,</hi> the end whereat he aimes who doth any thing, as he who doth injury to his neighbour, he aimes at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his own wealth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>finis rei</hi> or the end whereunto the deed it ſelfe done tends, is quite another thing than that the ſinner aimes at, as the breach of Gods law, provoking His wrath, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider ſome examples of this kinde. <hi>Eſay</hi> 3.8. Their tongue and their doings are againſt the Lord <hi>to provoke the eyes of His glory. Ier.</hi> 25.7. Ye have not hearkened to me faith the Lord, <hi>that ye might provoke me to anger</hi> with the works of your hands. It is not probable, that the people, though a ſinfull people, had any ſuch <hi>aime,</hi> or intended any ſuch thing, as <hi>to provoke</hi> the Lord. That of all other were a moſt fooliſh and impious enterpriſe. Doe we <hi>provoke the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, are we ſtronger than He? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.22.</p>
               <p>Surely they did not intend to <hi>provoke</hi> the Lord to wrath; they had no ſuch <hi>end,</hi> no more than they intended to doe themſelves hurt: Yet they did thoſe things which tended to provoſte the Lord to wrath, and in the effect tended to their own hurt. Mark how the Lord reaſons, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 25.6. <hi>Provoke</hi> me not to anger with the works of your hands, and I will doe you <hi>no hurt.</hi> Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, ſaith the Lord, <hi>to provoke</hi> me to anger with the works of your hands, <hi>to your own hurt.</hi> No doubt <hi>they intended not to provoke the Lord to anger; they intended not to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:65717:215"/>hurt.</hi> Yet the <hi>finis rei,</hi> the <hi>end that their ſin aimed at, was to provoke the Lord to anger, and to doe themſelves hurt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve how the Lord prizes neighbourly-love and faithful-dealing of man with man. He accounts the breach of brotherly love by unjuſt dealing, as done unto himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Then the ſoule that ſo doth, ſhall be guilty.</hi> So I would read the words, as here to end the ſentence. When a man or woman hath committed of all the ſins of men, to treſpaſs a treſpaſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, then that ſoule ſhall be guilty. I ſhall ſhew reaſon for this anon. Meantime, I am not alone in the opinion. For here <hi>Munſter</hi> ends the ſentence; and <hi>Piſcator, Martin Luther</hi> alſo, and two low Duch tranſlations, the French Bible and the Italians. And of our old Engliſh, <hi>Tyndall,</hi> and <hi>Couerdall,</hi> and two others. That ſoule hath guilt upon it. And indeed how can it be otherwiſe? If we conſider well what it is to ſin 1. againſt man, and to ſin 2. againſt God, and 3. to be guilty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſin againſt man, as directly or indirectly to rob him, deceive him, cheat him, goe beyond him, overreach him, is to break the ſociety of men, which is contrary to nature; as you heard before from the voice of nature. And the ſame Author fully preſſes it, lib. 3. de Off. <hi>Si etiam hoc natura preſcribit, ut homo homine quicunque ſit, ob eam ipſam cauſam quòd is homo ſit, conſultum velit, neceſie eſt, ſecundum eandem naturam, omnium utilitatem eſſe communm.</hi> If even <hi>nature</hi> preſcribe this, that <hi>man</hi> be willing to provide for the good of <hi>man</hi> who ever he is, even <hi>becauſe he is a man,</hi> its neceſſary, that, according to the ſame <hi>nature,</hi> the profit of all men be common. Whence by ſtrong reaſon he infers, that they who deny that any regard is to be had of thoſe among whom they live, but that, to encreaſe <hi>their own profit,</hi> they may <hi>rob or ſteal from others, Hi deriva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t communem humani generis ſocietatem,</hi> They, ſaith he, break the common ſociety of mankinde. So that he who commits any of all the ſins of men, as he <hi>breaks,</hi> ſo he is <hi>broken off from humane ſociety,</hi> and ſtands alone by himſelfe, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from all men. And that much more, that, by the ſame ſin, he ſin againſt God, as this Scripture ſpeaks expreſly.</p>
               <p>And the ſame voice of <hi>nature</hi> confirms it, as the ſame Author goes on. <hi>Quâ ſublatâ,</hi> take away humane ſociety, ſaith he, and bounty, liberality, goodneſs, juſtice is utterly taken away. <hi>Quae qui tollunt, etiam adverſus Deos immortales impii judicandi ſunt: Ab iis enim conſtitutam inter homines ſocietatem evertunt.</hi> Thus, ſaith he, who take away theſe they are to be judged impious againſt the immortal God; For they overturn that ſociety which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of God among men. So he. As therefore he who ſo ſins <hi>againſt man,</hi> breaks himſelf off from <hi>mankind,</hi> and ſtands alone by himſelf; ſo he who by ſinning againſt <hi>man,</hi> ſins alſo <hi>againſt God,</hi> he <hi>breaks himſelf off from God;</hi> according to that of the Prophet,

               </list>
               <p>His <hi>treſpaſs</hi> here is that thing wherein the guilty perſon wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his neighbour, ſo called by metonymie. Which is to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored</hi> in the <hi>head ſum.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>incapite ejus,</hi> as <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> turns it, and the Vulg. Latin, and the Chald. Paraph. as alſo the LXX.</p>
               <p>He muſt <hi>reſtore</hi> his treſpaſs: So five of our old Engliſh tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations have it; nor doth this our laſt amend them herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſtitution</hi> in the School is largely taken; ſometime according to the multiplicity of goods wherein our neighbour is unjuſtly damnified: for there are goods 1. of the ſoul, ſome naturall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, and others conferred on us by grace: 2. there are goods alſo proper to the body, as ſtrength, health, integrity of parts, beauty. 3. Goods of ſame, as a good name. 4. There are goods of <hi>fortune,</hi> as they are called, as riches; and theſe in the letter are here properly underſtood.</p>
               <p>And thus <hi>Reſtitution</hi> is deſcribed by <hi>Aquinas, actus juſtitiae com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutativae,</hi> an act of commutative juſtice, whereby the true owner is reſtored into poſſeſſion of his own goods. In which deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one main thing is wanting, which is ſupplied by <hi>Gabriel Biel, viz.</hi> That thoſe goods now <hi>restored</hi> were <hi>violently</hi> or <hi>fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently</hi> taken away. <hi>Violent</hi> and <hi>fraudulent dealing,</hi> deceit, cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, couſening, makes a breach upon <hi>proper intereſt,</hi> breaks the bond of humane ſociety, yea, the bond of union with God; ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the ſoul <hi>deſolate</hi> and alone without God and man.</p>
               <p>Theſe Bonds cannot be reunited, unleſs there be <hi>reſtitutio inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gri,</hi> until <hi>Reſtitution</hi> be made to the full. <hi>Non remittitur pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum niſi reſtituatur ablatum.</hi> The ſin of <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> (that <hi>Davus</hi> which makes all this trouble) is not remitted, unleſs what is taken away, be reſtored.</p>
               <p>This is an hard leſſon, will ſome ſay; who have otherwiſe <hi>learned Chriſt.</hi> Theſe are the very times which our Lord fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, ſhould come; that there ſhould be <hi>falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets.</hi> For ſome have imagined ſuch a <hi>Chriſt</hi> to themſelves, as hath ſo <hi>done</hi> and <hi>ſuffered all things for them,</hi> that he has left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for them to do, nothing for Chriſt to do in them; A Chriſt
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:65717:219"/>that hath been <hi>juſt for them, ſo that they need not be juſt.</hi> Such a Chriſt as has been ſober, chaſte, continent for them, ſo that they need not be ſo. Such a Chriſt as has <hi>paid their debts for them to God and man.</hi> Againſt theſe I ſhall lay down theſe two poſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are diſtinct <hi>dominions, rights,</hi> and <hi>proper intereſts</hi> in temporal things. How elſe can there be <hi>thefts?</hi> ſince theft is the taking away that which is anothers. If it be anothers, then hath that other no <hi>right</hi> in it, which he may call his. He hath <hi>dominion</hi> over it, power to uſe it, ſpend it, alien it, ſell it. Hence it is, that the Lord requires in every believer, contentation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. Yea, that every one be provident for time to come, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.25. that he make proviſion for himſelf, and his houſe; that he be <hi>not burdenſom to others,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12, 13. Yea, ſo provident he ought to be, that he have wherewith to <hi>pay publick charges, Matth.</hi> 22.21. Yea, that he may <hi>ſupply the neceſsities of the poor Saints, according to brotherly love,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. Yea, that, <hi>according to common love,</hi> he may have <hi>to give to him that needeth, Epheſ.</hi> 4.28. Now, were there no <hi>proper intereſt,</hi> no <hi>meum</hi> nor <hi>tuum</hi> in the world, no man could call any thing <hi>his own,</hi> or <hi>uſe it, ſpend it, alien it:</hi> nor have <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be content.</hi> Nor would there be <hi>buying,</hi> or <hi>ſelling, giving</hi> or <hi>receiving, borrowing</hi> or <hi>lending,</hi> or any other act which ſuppoſeth property.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>right</hi> and <hi>proper intereſt</hi> in temporal things, is <hi>not founded in grace;</hi> ſo that a man who hath <hi>grace,</hi> may not take away that which is another mans who hath <hi>no grace.</hi> Our Lord determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this long ſince, when he forbad his own <hi>gracious</hi> people, to intermeddle with the <hi>graceleſs Edomites, Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Amerites;</hi> and that they ſhould by no means invade their poſſeſſion; and his reaſon is convictive; he <hi>had given them, their poſſeſsions, Deut.</hi> 2. Which yet will appear more forcible, if we conſider the ends why the Lord gives his temporal good things unto <hi>graceleſs</hi> men; that they may <hi>ſeek out God, Acts</hi> 17.27. that they may <hi>repent, Rom.</hi> 2.4. So that he who takes away the goods of <hi>graceleſs men,</hi> he hinders them from the means of <hi>finding God,</hi> and <hi>repenting</hi> of their ſins. Yea, if thoſe two things be granted, 1. That the <hi>dominion and right</hi> to temporal things is founded <hi>in grace.</hi> 2. That a man may be his own judge, who is, and who is not in the <hi>ſtate of grace,</hi> no man ſhall quietly poſſeſs any thing, he has. If a gracious man ſteals, his grace is no grace. Yea, hence will follow a prodigious diſtinction of theevery, that which a <hi>graceleſs,</hi> and that which a <hi>gracious</hi> man commits.</p>
               <p>Come we to the meaſure and manner of <hi>Restitution.</hi> He ſhall <hi>restore his treſpaſs with the principal</hi> thereof, and adde unto it the fifth part thereof, and give unto him againſt whom he hath treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed.</p>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:65717:219"/>
               <p n="1">1. He ſhall <hi>reſtore</hi> his treſpaſs; that is, the thing wherein he hath treſpaſſed, by a Metonymie. But what is here meant by the words following? <hi>with the principal</hi> thereof. What is this <hi>principal?</hi> Is it ſome other thing beſide the <hi>treſpaſs?</hi> Surely no: Why then is it ſaid, he ſhall <hi>reſtore</hi> the <hi>treſpaſs with the principal thereof,</hi> if the <hi>principal</hi> and <hi>treſpaſs</hi> be the ſame thing? This doubt muſt be cleared by a ſpiritual ſenſe; of which anon. Meantime, as to the letter, we may obſerve, The wiſdom and goodneſs of the moſt righteous God the Judge of all the World, in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all impediments and lets from among men, that his <hi>royal law</hi> might take place in their hearts; ſo that we might <hi>owe nothing unto any man, but to love one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what reaſon is there for this Reſtitution? What is more juſt then the rule of the moſt righteous Judge of all the World? The Lord tryeth (or purgeth) the righteous; but the wicked, and him that loveth violence (or rapine) his ſoul hateth.<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>11.</hi> ver. <hi>7.</hi>

So the Lord bleſſed the <hi>latter end</hi> of <hi>Job</hi> more then the beginning, &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 42.12. Ye have heard of the patience of <hi>Job,</hi>

                  </note> and have ſeen the <hi>end</hi> or <hi>reward</hi> of the Lord, <hi>James</hi> 5.11. But the tranſgreſſours ſhall be deſtroyed together: The <hi>end</hi> (or reward) of the wicked ſhall be cut off.</p>
               <p>And truly if men patiently wait on the Lord, they ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that he will bring forth the <hi>flying rowl</hi> in his due time, even the <hi>curſe</hi> that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth, &amp;c. and it ſhall enter into the houſe of the <hi>thief,</hi> and into the houſe of him that ſweareth <hi>falſly</hi> by Gods Name (forſwearing what he has <hi>ſtollen</hi>) and it ſhall remain in the midſt of his houſe, and ſhall conſume it with the timber thereof, and the ſtones thereof, <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.1.—4. For it muſt have a time; becauſe 1. God is patient and long ſuffering, and would not that any ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. And the fin being conceived in the heart as in the womb, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.14. it muſt have a time to bring forth: and ſo muſt the judgement and the curſe which goes along collaterally with the ſin. And when ſin is perfected, it bringeth forth death. And when once the curſe hath ſetled, it is no ſtarter, but it <hi>remaines in the midſt of the houſe;</hi> (for puniſhments were wont to be inflicted on the houſes of malefactors, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.11. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.29. to root out their name and memory.) And when the curſe hath taken up its place in the houſe, its hot idle there, but it <hi>conſumes and eats</hi> where ever it comes. For as the <hi>bleſsing increaſeth, Gen.</hi> 9.1. So the <hi>curſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth,</hi> and brings to nothing, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. This curſe
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:65717:220"/>goes along with goods however unjuſtly gotten by fraud or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The ſtory of <hi>Glaucus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> which <hi>Herodotus</hi> reports, is remarkable. He had received a ſum of money of a certain <hi>Mileſian,</hi> for the uſe of his children under age: <hi>Glaucus</hi> denied the receipt of the money, with an oath. <hi>Glaucus</hi> afterward guilty, conſulted with the Oracle; which gave him this anſwer; That the curſe

               <p>Which as the Hiſtorian affirms, afterward accordingly came to paſs.

               </p>
               <p>Yea, we may refer the ruines and deſtructions of Kingdoms and Commonweals, as wiſe Hiſtorians and Stateſmen do, unto the ſame cauſes. For of that Anarchy and ruin of <hi>Judah,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ye read, <hi>Eſay</hi> 3. ye finde the cauſe ver. 14. the <hi>ſpoil of the poor</hi> is in their houſes.

As a Cage is full of Birds, ſo are their houſes full of <hi>deceit.</hi> And <hi>Zephany</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced an heavy judgement againſt the Jews, Ver. 9. among other cauſes deſerving it, he ſaith that the ſervants filled their Maſters houſes with <hi>violence and deceit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let me again minde you of what one of the moſt antient Fathers hath written concerning theſe very ſins, whereof the Lord here ſpeaks; <hi>Abſit, abſit, inquam, ut haec ego de aliquo fidelium ſentiam!</hi> Far, yea far be it from me, that I ſhould think theſe things of any of the faithful! And good reaſon; ſince this is the character given of thoſe Primitive times: <hi>Adeò ſancta erat illis temporibus fides, ut fallere aliquos poſſe non crederetur.</hi> There was ſuch <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> and integrity among them, that they thought it <hi>impoſsible</hi> that any one of them ſhould <hi>deceive.</hi> And becauſe they themſelves loved <hi>truth</hi> and faithfulneſs, and knew not what it was to <hi>deceive,</hi> they thought no man would deceive them. So the <hi>Virgin-Church</hi> might ſay of her ſelf,
<q>
                     <l>—Ego neſcia rerum,</l>
                     <l>Difficilem culpae ſuſpicor eſſe viam.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon this very conſideration, that holy Father underſtood the former part of this law ſpiritually. And I believe, upon the ſame grounds, we may ſo underſtand the latter part of it. Let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and make trial.</p>
               <p>This ground we may lay, or rather, its laid to our hand, <hi>The law is ſpiritual,</hi> and this law, as hath appear'd in the former part of it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The Lord in the former words gives us a deſcription of a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> A man or woman who <hi>marvellouſly ſeparates</hi> him or himſelf to <hi>vow a vow</hi> of a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> to <hi>ſeparate</hi> themſelves unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Nazarites</hi> were either perpetual, as <hi>Samſon, Judges</hi> 13.7. And <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.11. Or for a certain time, as <hi>Paul</hi> and others with him, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.18.</p>
               <p>This vow, although according to the ceremony, it required abſtinence from certain things, as hath been ſhewen, yet in the realty and ſubſtance of it, it imported a dedication and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holy perſons unto God, although they abſtained not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly from thoſe things. Thus the <hi>Rechabites</hi> who abſtained from Wine, <hi>Jer.</hi> 35. are accounted Nazarites by <hi>Suidas,</hi> whether they abſtained from the other two, it appears not. Nor could <hi>Samſon</hi> exactly obſerve that prohibition <hi>not to come at a dead body,</hi> when he made ſo many ſlaughters among the Philiſtines, <hi>heaps upon heaps.</hi> So that in a large ſenſe, we may ſay of all devout perſons
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:65717:222"/>who renounce the world and the luſts thereof, and wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote and <hi>conſecrate</hi> themſelves unto God, that they are ſpiritual <hi>Nazarites.</hi> Such an one was <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who long before them both, and before the inſtitution of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial <hi>ſeparation,</hi> was called a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> as I have ſhewen on <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. <hi>v.</hi> 26.

                  <q>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde haec farrago loquendi venerit in linguas?</q> How come we to ſpeak thus but from too little care of our <hi>ſouls?</hi> which is helped on by miſ-tranſlation.</p>
               <p>If we come at a dead ſoul, and ſo defile our own ſouls, all our former labour is utterly loſt. <hi>The dayes</hi> that were before, ſhall fall, becauſe his <hi>ſeparation</hi> was defiled, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.12. He muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin again. And there is the ſame reaſon with the ſpiritual <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, Ezech.</hi> 18.24. When the righteous man turneth away from his <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and committeth <hi>iniquity,</hi> and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth, ſhall he live? All the <hi>righteouſneſs that he hath done, ſhall not be mentioned:</hi> in his treſpaſs that he hath treſpaſſed, and in the ſin that he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he die.</p>
               <p>This no doubt, is a very great <hi>reſtraint</hi> upon the <hi>Nazarite.</hi> But a caſe may be put wherein he may ſeem to be releaſed from this <hi>reſtraint.</hi> What if his Father or Mother, his brother or Siſter die? may not the <hi>Nazarite</hi> go in to them, or one or other of them, when they die?</p>
               <p>It is true, Father and Mother, Brother and Siſter, they are near and endeering <hi>relations,</hi> and ſuch as may much win upon us: This is a racite objection made unto the former ſtrict precept. Unto which the Lord makes expreſs anſwer in the following words.</p>
               <p>He ſhall not make himſelf <hi>unclean</hi> for his Father or his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for his Brother or for his Siſter, when they die.</p>
               <p>In theſe words are contain'd, the great reſtraint of the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi> from uncleanneſs.</p>
               <p>Herein we have two divine Axioms.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Nazarites</hi> Father or Mother, or Brother, or Siſter, by dying, become unclean.</item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>Nazarite</hi> muſt not make himſelf <hi>unclean</hi> for his Father or his Mother, for his Brother, or for his Siſter.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The latter of theſe ſuppoſes the former; for unleſs the <hi>dead</hi> were unclean, how could they render the <hi>Nazarite</hi> unclean?</p>
               <p>But it may yet be enquired, what <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> this is in the <hi>dead father</hi> or <hi>mother, brother, or ſister.</hi> For as for <hi>natural uncleanneſs,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there be in the <hi>dead</hi> man a reſolution of the <hi>humours,</hi> and in time of the <hi>elements,</hi> which may be <hi>noyſom,</hi> and perhaps <hi>contagious,</hi>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:65717:224"/>yet neither of theſe is ſo ſpeedy, as commonly their <hi>Funerals</hi> are. However to come in to the ſame houſe where the <hi>dead are,</hi> or to accompany the corps to the grave, can be no <hi>annoyance;</hi> becauſe the <hi>ſoul</hi> being departed, and the <hi>natural heat</hi> gone, which is the <hi>vehicle,</hi> and conveys <hi>contagion</hi> and <hi>infection</hi> while there is <hi>life</hi> in the body, the body being now <hi>dead</hi> conveys no <hi>contagion, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> unto thoſe who <hi>come at it:</hi> ſo the <hi>Italian</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, When the <hi>beaſt is dead,</hi> the <hi>poyſon is dead</hi> with it. Thus much we may ſay for <hi>natural uncleanneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>ceremonial uncleanneſs</hi> its meerly <hi>poſitive;</hi> and, according to the nature of a <hi>ceremony,</hi> it is, <hi>Pro arbitrio inſtituentis,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of him who ordains it; and ſo only <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>for a time;</hi> whence <hi>caeremonia</hi> hath the name from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, time; becauſe it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, only for a <hi>certain time;</hi> and that ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant alſo of ſomewhat that's <hi>real, moral,</hi> and <hi>laſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remaines therefore that the <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> here ſpoken of is only <hi>ceremonial,</hi> and that which imports unto us a <hi>morall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs.</hi> And what's that? <hi>Sin and iniquity</hi> is the only <hi>true uncleanneſs.</hi> And therefore its called by ſuch names as in <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> are <hi>unclean;</hi> as <hi>mire</hi> and <hi>vomit,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. the <hi>menstruous cloth</hi> of an <hi>unclean</hi> woman, <hi>Eſay</hi> 64.6.

Yea, ſuch is the <hi>odiouſneſs</hi> and <hi>loathſomeneſs</hi> of it, that what ever in <hi>nature</hi> is, or ſeems <hi>filthy, ſin</hi> borrows a name from it.</p>
               <p>This <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> is of a <hi>diffuſive</hi> and <hi>ſpreading nature,</hi> both in them in whom it firſt is, and in thoſe alſo to whom they do <hi>affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care ſcabiem,</hi> they communicate their <hi>uncleanneſs.</hi> The <hi>leproſie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with a <hi>ſpot of uncleanneſs,</hi> and ſpreads it ſelf in the skin, and <hi>defiles</hi> the whole man, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. <hi>Iniquity</hi> kindles from a <hi>ſpark;</hi> then it burns all before it <hi>like a fire, Eſay</hi> 9.18.

               </p>
               <p>But what reaſon may there be, why the Lord gives ſpecial charge to the <hi>Nazarite,</hi> that he come not at <hi>his Father</hi> or <hi>his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his Brother</hi> or <hi>his Siſter,</hi> when they die.

               <p n="2">2. The words are conſiderable as the reaſon of the law preceding. The <hi>Nazarite</hi> muſt not drink wine, poll his head; or defile himſelf by his father or his mother when they die, <hi>becauſe the Crown</hi> of his God is upon his <hi>head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The will of the Lord is, that the <hi>ſpiritual Nazarite</hi> for no perſon ſhould become unclean. Its a known rule, <hi>Primum in unoquo<expan>

               <p>This is a ground of exhortation to the true <hi>Nazarites</hi> of the <hi>Philadelphian Church;</hi> its the Lords exhortation to them, <hi>Keep what thou haſt, and let no man take thy Crown, Revel.</hi> 3.11. Theſe are they who are made <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> unto God. Now it is not for <hi>Kings</hi> to drink wine, nor for <hi>Princes</hi> to drink ſtrong drink, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.4. Nor is it for <hi>Prieſts</hi> to drink <hi>wine</hi> nor ſtrong drink, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.9. Nor is it for the ſpiritual <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> to diſtemper their <hi>ſouls</hi> with the <hi>joyes</hi> and <hi>delights</hi> of the earthly life, as I have ſhewen. But they ought to be wholly <hi>ſubject</hi> unto their God, to whom they are <hi>conſecrated,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Crown</hi> they wear.</p>
               <p>Nor ought they to <hi>touch any unclean thing,</hi> whether of <hi>man</hi> or <hi>beast.</hi>

                  <hi>unclean</hi> onely <hi>untill the evening,</hi> Levit. 11.32. but the <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> of a <hi>man</hi> polluted a man and made him <hi>unclean ſeven dayes,</hi> Num. 19.11. And in nature the <hi>ſtench</hi> of a <hi>priſon</hi> is <hi>loathſome;</hi> but the ſmell of a Stable is, to many, delightful. It is true, the <hi>brutiſh</hi> and <hi>carnal uncleanneſs pollutes;</hi> but the <hi>uncleanneſs of a man,</hi> as he is a man, <hi>pollutes ſeven times more.

               <p>And in all theſe, there ought great <hi>ſtrictneſs</hi> to be uſed: For there is not the ſame reaſon of the <hi>Divine Law</hi> which is of our <hi>Humane Laws.</hi> We ſay, <hi>De minimis non curat Lex,</hi> The Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not the <hi>least matters.</hi> As the Law forbids annoyance of the High-ways: Nor muſt the <hi>Carkaſe</hi> of a <hi>Horſe</hi> or <hi>Dog</hi> or the like be thrown into a <hi>Common rode.</hi> But what if a <hi>dead Mouſe</hi> be thrown there? The anſwer is, <hi>De minimis non curat Lex;</hi> The Law takes no notice of things ſo ſmall. And ſome, out of their <hi>Epicurean ſpirit,</hi> would perſwade us, that <hi>Non vacat exiguis rebus adeſſe Jovi,</hi> that God is not at leiſure to heed <hi>ſmall matters.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which pretence, they plead for their <hi>infirmities,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>largeſt cize;</hi> and by that name, they underſtand their <hi>groſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual ſins.</hi> But the wiſe man tells us, that he who neglects <hi>ſmall things</hi> ſhall fall <hi>by little and little, Eccluſ.</hi> 19.1. Surely our God neglects not, but forbids and puniſhes even the <hi>ſmalleſt ſins</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and unrepented of and not forſaken. Therefore <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. of this Chapter, the Lord forbids the <hi>Nazarite</hi> not only the drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>ſtrong drink,</hi> but alſo <hi>Vinegar of Wine,</hi>

                  <hi>Wine:</hi> For what is <hi>Wine</hi> but the <hi>juice or liquor</hi> of <hi>Grapes,</hi> if <hi>the</hi> Wine be made of Grapes? For <hi>Wine</hi> may be made of many other things; as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> writes of <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>The Lord here, when he would prohibite the <hi>Nazarite</hi> the uſe of <hi>Wine,</hi> he forbids all, what ever belongs to it. And thus ſome underſtand the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.33. when he ſaith, <hi>ſwear not at all:</hi> That he well knowing how frequent ſwearing and forſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was among the people, and how true it is, <hi>Qui facilè jurat, facilè pejerat,</hi> He who eaſily ſwears, eaſily forſwears himſelf; That therefore he might reſtrain men from that frequent ſin of <hi>perjury,</hi> he prohibites what uſually leads men thereunto. Thus the Lord having given ſtrict charge to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he ſhould not <hi>eat of the forbidden fruit, Adam</hi> gives charge to <hi>Eve,</hi> that <hi>ſhe ſhould
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:65717:227"/>not touch it:</hi> as we charge our children not to come <hi>neer the well.</hi> And thus the wiſe man gives charge to his children, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.14, 15. Enter not into the <hi>path</hi> of the wicked; go not in the <hi>way</hi> of evil men, avoid it, paſs not by it; turn from it, and paſs away. And the wiſe men of the Jews perſwaded the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> that they might the better obſerve their <hi>vows,</hi> not to go into the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards.</p>
               <p>This no doubt is a great error in the ſons of men, they fear leſt they ſhould commit ſome <hi>great ſins,</hi> and regard not the <hi>leſs ſins,</hi> which inſenſibly diſpoſe them to the committing of the <hi>greateſt.</hi> And therefore the Scripture warns us that we take great heed of the <hi>little ſins.</hi> A <hi>little leaven leavens the whole lump,</hi> Gal. 5.9. And he who keeps the <hi>whole Law</hi> and offendeth in <hi>one point</hi> is guilty <hi>of all,</hi> Jam. 2.10. O take heed, leſt any <hi>root of bitterneſs</hi> ſpringing up trouble you, and thereby <hi>many be defiled, Heb.</hi> 12.15. Whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the will of the Lord is <hi>our ſanctification, &amp; in modico &amp; in magno,</hi> our <hi>whole,</hi> our <hi>thorow obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For in this vow of a <hi>Nazarite</hi> was prefigured unto us, the <hi>ſtate of perfection;</hi> ſuch as was held forth unto us in the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> on whoſe forehead was the golden plate with this inſcription <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This type was really and in the Truth fulfilled in Chriſt <hi>the true Nazarite,</hi> the <hi>true High Prieſt.</hi> The ſame <hi>perfect life</hi> is held forth unto all, and required of all, who are <hi>Chriſts.</hi> What elſe means the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. where he ſaith, <hi>Come out from among them?</hi> (which is alſo the Prophets invitation, and call unto us, <hi>to come forth out of the confuſed ſpiritual Babel.</hi>) And be ye <hi>ſeparate;</hi> be <hi>true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites, ſeparate your ſelves unto the Lord. Touch no unclean thing; come not at any dead ſoul.</hi> Be not ſo endeared unto Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Brother or Siſter, when they are <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> as to be <hi>defiled for them.</hi> Though the <hi>Prieſt of the ſecond order,</hi> might be <hi>defiled,</hi> the true <hi>Nazarites,</hi> who are made like unto the <hi>great High Prieſt,</hi> as he might not be defiled, no, not for his Father or for his Mother, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.10.11. So neither ought we out of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural endeerment or indulgence, to be ſpiritually polluted, no, not for our Fathers and Mothers.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch as Chriſt hath ſuffered in the fleſh, arm your ſelves with the ſame (ſuffering) minde: For he who hath ſuffered in the fleſh hath ceaſed from ſin. He who doth the will of my <hi>Father which is in heaven,</hi> he is now adopted into the <hi>Divine linage,</hi> he ſhall be my <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Siſter</hi> and <hi>Brother,</hi> Mat. 12.50. And God the <hi>Father</hi> ſpeaks unto ſuch <hi>Nazarites</hi> who <hi>ſeparate</hi> themſelves to the Lord, unto ſuch Levites who in this caſe, ſay to their <hi>Father</hi> and to their <hi>Mother,</hi> I have not ſeen him, neither did he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:65717:227"/>his brethren, nor do they acknowledge their children; for they have obſerved Gods word, and kept his Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.9. Vnto ſuch <hi>Levites,</hi> unto ſuch <hi>Nazarites,</hi> ſuch <hi>ſeparated</hi> ones, he ſaith, Be ye <hi>ſeparate; own no father nor mother nor brother nor ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon earth,</hi> and I will <hi>receive you,</hi> and I will be a father unto you, and ye ſhall be my ſons and daughters, ſaith the Lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, 18.</p>
               <p>Be we exhorted to <hi>ſeparate</hi> our ſelves unto the Lord, to become true <hi>Nazarites,</hi> that we may obtain the <hi>Crown</hi> of our God. This ſeems to be the drift of the Apoſtles exhortation. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. as I ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>How ſhall we obtain this <hi>Crown</hi> of our God? The <hi>Nazarite</hi> by wearing of his <hi>hair</hi> profeſſed himſelf <hi>ſubject</hi> unto God, as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath <hi>power</hi> on her head, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>This <hi>ſubjection</hi> is unto the will and law of God, and he is in meditation of the law day and night, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. Hereby he is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred humble, contrite and mortified, endures temptations, and ſo obtains the <hi>Crown of life, James</hi> 1.12.</p>
               <p>See how this was prefigured in <hi>Eſther</hi> the <hi>inviſible and hidden Church, Esther</hi> 2. She had <hi>neither father nor mother, v.</hi> 7. they were both <hi>dead.</hi> Such a <hi>virgin Church</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks unto; Hearken, O daughter, and conſider; forſake thine own people and thy fathers houſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. But did ſhe not make her ſelf <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean by her father or her mother when they died?</hi> No, <hi>Mordecai</hi> took her for his daughter. <hi>Mordecai:</hi> who is that? <hi>Amata contritio,</hi> bitter contrition. A figure of the holy Law, which renders us <hi>contrite</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jair</hi> the light. Or <hi>Mordecai</hi> is <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens contritionem,</hi> teaching <hi>contrition.</hi> He becomes the father of <hi>Eſther;</hi> or <hi>Myrrha contrita, Myrrh contrite.

Martin Luther</hi> alſo turns them by one word, <hi>Sundwaſſer,</hi> ſo <hi>Piſcator,</hi> and one Low Dutch. So <hi>Ainſworth.</hi> And although the LXX have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, water of purifying, whom our old and new Tranſlators fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, yet cannot the words be ſo turnd without a trope. Nor hath the Tranſlator of the Chald. Paraphraſt dealt candidly; who turns <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Aquas luſtrationis, waters of purging,</hi> which exactly anſwers the Hebrew, <hi>waters of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what <hi>water</hi> is it that can <hi>purifie</hi> the man from his ſin? we read not yet that the <hi>water of ſeparation</hi> is commanded to be made, which is firſt enjoyn'd, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. and not before.</p>
               <p>The Jews have a good rule, which is of uſe here, <hi>Non eſt prius &amp; poſterius in lege. There is neither before nor after in the Law.</hi> So that howſoever as yet the <hi>ſin-water</hi> were not commanded to be made; yet that which was typified by it, the <hi>blood of Chriſt</hi> (the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8.) is the true <hi>holy water,</hi> or <hi>ſin-water.</hi> Yea, leſt any age ſhould want an expedient and effectual mean for the <hi>purging</hi> and <hi>cleanſing</hi> from ſin, the Apoſtle applying this <hi>type</hi> unto the <hi>truth,</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.13, 14. If the <hi>blood</hi> of Buls and Goats, and the aſhes of an <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſprinkling</hi> the <hi>unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh,</hi> how much more ſhall the <hi>blood of Chriſt, who, through the eternal Spirit,</hi> offered himſelf without ſpot unto God, <hi>purge our conſcience from dead works,</hi> to ſerve <hi>the living God?</hi> Whereby the Apoſtle holds forth unto us that <hi>everlasting ſin-water,</hi> the <hi>pretious blood</hi> and <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>which cleanſeth us from all our ſins,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p>But as our Tranſlators, in the firſt part of the <hi>Levites cleanſing,</hi> make no mention at all of <hi>ſin</hi> which is to be <hi>purged;</hi> ſo neither in the <hi>ſecond</hi> part of it, do they expreſs the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the <hi>Raſor</hi> which they muſt <hi>let paſs over all their fleſh.</hi> But inſtead of this,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:65717:229"/>they put what they judged equipollent hereunto, <hi>let them ſhave all their fleſh;</hi> which is not a genuine <hi>tranſlation,</hi> but an <hi>expoſition.</hi> And they caſt the true <hi>tranſlation</hi> of the words into the margent. And what becomes of them and all the reſt, in the Pocket Bible?</p>
               <p>The third part of the <hi>Levites cleanſing, [Waſhing their clothes,]</hi> is tacitly implyed the whole myſtery of <hi>ſprinkling the ſin-water,</hi> and <hi>cutting off the hair, viz.</hi> the <hi>purifying from the ſuperfluity of naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> even the <hi>ſinne</hi> it ſelf.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>ſervice</hi> of the <hi>Levites</hi> about the Tabernacle of meeting was, a <hi>laborious ſervice.</hi> Its called in the text, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the greateſt pains and toyl that men undergo, in <hi>peaceable times,</hi> the <hi>labours of the ground,</hi> in plowing, ſowing, harrowing, fallowing, twifallowing, trifallowing, &amp;c. and this yearly; <hi>Nam redit agricolis labor actùs in orbem. The Plowmans labour turns round every year.</hi> Its the greateſt labour and pains that men can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, in <hi>troubleſome times,</hi> therefore its called <hi>warfare</hi> in the text. It contains in it ſelf compendiouſly all evil: And therefore war is called <hi>evil,</hi> as the ſum of all evils, <hi>Eſay</hi> 45.7.</p>
               <p>The principal <hi>labour</hi> of the <hi>Levite,</hi> was <hi>bearing the burden of the Tabernacle.</hi> Ye finde all the parts and utenſels of the Tabernacle divided among the <hi>Kohathites,</hi> the <hi>Gerſhonites,</hi> and the <hi>Merarites, Numb.</hi> 4. which they muſt take up and <hi>bear,</hi> ſo often as the Camp removed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Myſticè.</hi> Such is the <hi>labour</hi> of the <hi>ſpiritual Levite</hi> in the <hi>greater and better Tabernacle, Hebr.</hi> 9.11. He has his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> his great <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>toyl</hi> about a worldly Tabernacle of earthly minded men. He breaks up the <hi>fallow grounds,</hi> the <hi>earthly hearts</hi> of men, which have long <hi>lien lay.</hi> He <hi>ſowes</hi> the feed of the Word which the <hi>fowles</hi> of <hi>the air,</hi> the <hi>evil ſpirits</hi> devour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.4. with 19. The <hi>Sun of perſecution</hi> ſcorcheth it, v. 5.6. with 20.21. The <hi>thorny cares choak it,</hi> v. 7. with 22. And it is well, if one fourth part of the ſoyl, prove good and fruitful, v. 8. with 23. So that the moſt part of his <hi>labour</hi> is quite loſt, and he ſpends his <hi>ſtrength in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is that the ſpiritual <hi>Levite</hi> is compared to the <hi>laborious Ox, Deut.</hi> 25.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9, 10. He <hi>treads out the corn,</hi> he <hi>ſeparates</hi> the <hi>pure grain</hi> from the <hi>husk,</hi> he brings forth the <hi>Spirit</hi> out of the <hi>Letter.</hi> So that <hi>great increaſe is by the strength of the Ox, Pro.</hi> 14.4. Yet too often the <hi>mouth of the laborious Ox is muzled,</hi> contrary to the command of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9. by ſenſual, brutiſh, earthly-minded men.</p>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:65717:230"/>
               <p>But the greateſt <hi>labour</hi> of the <hi>ſpiritual Levit,</hi> is the <hi>bearing</hi> of <hi>the Tabernacle</hi> and the parts of it, even that <hi>ſpiritual Tabernacle</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt dwels, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. Of which <hi>burden</hi> even <hi>Moſes,</hi> and he a <hi>Levit,</hi> complains, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.9. and elſewhere.</p>
               <p>In this regard, the ſpiritual <hi>Levit</hi> was figured by the <hi>Camel,</hi> a creature that ſeems to be made to bear <hi>burdens;</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he is ſo ready to <hi>bear</hi> them, that he kneels down that the <hi>burden may be laid upon him.</hi> Of his hair, penitential garments were made of old; ſuch were thoſe of <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt: Does God take care for Oxen?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9. or Camels? For our ſakes no doubt was that written. Theſe are part of the herd called <hi>Animalia Dei, Gods animals, Pſal.</hi> 68.10. Among thoſe <hi>beaſts</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>born, Matth.</hi> 2. the reſigned patient beaſts, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.4. <hi>beaſts before thee, Pſal.</hi> 73.22. made to <hi>bear the burdens</hi> of the weak ones, their many <hi>frailties</hi> and <hi>infirmities,</hi> their <hi>murmurings</hi> and <hi>repinings, their contumacies and obstinacies;</hi> while meantime, in great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and long-ſuffering, they endeavour their repentance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Note here a great difference between the temperal and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>warfare.</hi> 1. In the temporal the enemies are outward. In the ſpiritual, they are inward according to the former; <hi>Kings go out to battel,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.1. According to the latter, <hi>the Levites go in to war the warfare of the ſervice, Numb.</hi> 8.24. 2. The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> gives us another difference: For every <hi>battle of the warriour, is with confuſed noiſe,</hi> and garments rolled in bloods: But this with <hi>burning and ſmell of fire;</hi> as in the battle of <hi>Gideon</hi> againſt the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites, Eſay</hi> 9.5. which was not managed by <hi>might or by power,</hi> but by Gods <hi>Spirit, which is as fire.</hi> So that when that <hi>light and fire appears,</hi> all the <hi>divided judgements</hi> (ſo the <hi>Midianites</hi> ſignifie) fall foul one upon another, and <hi>Gideon</hi> who <hi>breaks and treads under the ſin</hi> (as his name ſignifies) obtains a glorious victory. O that <hi>unto us that childe were born, that unto us that ſon were given who may make good</hi> his great name in us, according to the following words.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Men engage themſelves in outward wars, to ſatisfie the policies, luſts, ambition, revenge and covetouſneſs of the worldly Potentates,—<hi>Delirant Reges; Plectuntur Achivi. Ahab</hi> was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and covetous; and for the ſatisfaction of his luſts, all <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> mſt be ſcattered on the hills, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.17.</p>
               <p>But in the inward <hi>warfare</hi> the ſpiritual warriour endures hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as a <hi>good ſouldier</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, he entangleth not himſelf in the affairs of this life, <hi>that he may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a ſouldier,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.</p>
               <p>O ye Levites! theſe things <hi>belong unto you,</hi> ſaith the Lord, v. 24. if we <hi>cleave</hi> unto the Lord, as we all profeſs our ſelves to do, and it is the buſineſs which the <hi>name</hi> it ſelf imports, how can we <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here</hi> unto any creature which may <hi>intervene</hi> and <hi>hinder our imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate union and cleaving unto him?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:65717:230"/>
               <p n="2">2. From the <hi>age of fifty years,</hi> they ſhall <hi>ceaſe</hi> from <hi>waiting</hi> on the ſervice of the Tabernacle of meeting. There ſeems ſome jarring between <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. and this place, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. For in the former place, the time of the <hi>Levites warfare</hi> begins at thirty years of age. But here <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. their <hi>warfare</hi> begins five years ſooner, <hi>viz.</hi> at the twenty fifth year of their age.</p>
               <p>The reconciliation is eaſie, according to Rabbi <hi>Solomon,</hi> and others who follow him. That, whereas the Levites <hi>warfare</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of two parts, whereof the former was ſpent in <hi>learning</hi> the rudiments of thoſe <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>ceremonies</hi> which belonged unto their office. This was the firſt part of their warfare, which continued from the twenty fifth year of their age, until they were thirty years old. At that age, being the age of <hi>full ſtrength,</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the ſecond part of their <hi>warfare,</hi> wherein they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued twenty years, <hi>viz.</hi> until the fiftieth year of their age, when the <hi>bodily ſtrength</hi> of a man begins to fail him.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon is evident. Nature now <hi>weary,</hi> requires eaſe and reſt. The ſouls of the Levites, as well as others, dwell in <hi>houſes of clay, Job</hi> 4.19. weak and brittle. And although the <hi>ſoul</hi> in her <hi>other houſe,</hi> her <hi>aſtral body,</hi> be ſtrong, vigorous, and able for action, yet while it acts in and by an <hi>elementary body</hi> which daily moulders away, in that caſe, though the <hi>ſpirit be willing,</hi> yet the <hi>fleſh is weak.</hi> Though there may be <hi>actûs eliciti, actions drawn forth of the ſoul;</hi> Yea, and <hi>imperati,</hi> actions commanded alſo by it, yet they muſt needs be <hi>weakly performed,</hi> when the keepers of the <hi>houſe</hi> tremble, and the ſtrong men bow themſelves, and the grinders fail, becauſe they grinde little, and they that look out of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes be darkned, &amp;c. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.3.</p>
               <p>Whence we learn, 1. That the Lord requires our <hi>full ſtrength</hi> to be wholly ſpent in <hi>warring</hi> the <hi>warfare</hi> of his <hi>ſervice.</hi> The <hi>full ſtrength</hi> of a man begins about the thirtieth year of his age. At that age <hi>Joſeph</hi> began to <hi>ſerve</hi> the Lord in the kingdom of <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 41.46. and <hi>David</hi> in the kingdom over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> began his reign and the <hi>ſervice</hi> of <hi>God and his generation,</hi> at the ſame age, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.36. And at the ſame age the Lord Jeſus being the <hi>truth</hi> of both theſe types, he began to <hi>ſerve</hi> the Lord, in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral diſpenſation, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord requires all our <hi>time of ſtrength</hi> to be imployed in the ſpiritual <hi>warfare,</hi> even from the <hi>full ſtrength</hi> at thirty years, <hi>until the decay of it at fifty.</hi> Nor will any one, who <hi>ſerves the Lord out of love, which is the higheſt and moſt acceptable ſervice, Exod.</hi> 20.6. Otherwiſe conceive, but that all that <hi>time</hi> is utterly miſ-ſpent and loſt, which is imployed in any other <hi>ſervice;</hi> ſince the Lord requires <hi>all our ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>all our time</hi> to be ſpent in his <hi>ſervice of love, Luke</hi> 10.37. There is an <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>enough</hi> and more then <hi>enough</hi> of our <hi>time</hi> waſted in the <hi>ſervice</hi> of ſin, how little ſoever of our
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:65717:231"/>
                  <hi>time</hi> hath periſhed in it. And here I meet with a Scripture, which I beleeve, is much miſtaken, 1 <hi>Peter.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4. Foraſmuch therefore as Chriſt hath ſuffered in the fleſh, arm your ſelves with <hi>the ſame minde; becauſe</hi> he who hath <hi>ſuffered in the fleſh, hath ceaſed from ſin; that he ſhould live no longer the reſt of his time in the fleſh, to the luſts of men but to the will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle having propounded his general exhortation, in the firſt words; <hi>Arm your ſelves</hi> with the ſame minde, according to the patern of <hi>Chriſts ſuffering in the fleſh;</hi> he explains, what he means by <hi>ſuffering in the fleſh,</hi> viz. <hi>ceaſing from ſin;</hi> which expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation given, he proceeds in his general exhortation, interpoſing himſelf, by a <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">3. It is not the will of the Lord, that his ſouldiers ſhould be <hi>alwayes warring,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>alwayes be fighting.</hi> Surely men fight not but with hope of <hi>overcoming,</hi> and an <hi>end</hi> there muſt be of their <hi>fighting;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Lord of hoſts</hi> engageth us in this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and he does <hi>nothing in vain.</hi> Yea, we read, that the Prophets muſt comfort <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and tell her, that her <hi>warfare is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, Eſay</hi> 40.2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a <hi>time</hi> when the ſpiritual Levite is <hi>diſcharged from warring the warfare of the Lord;</hi> a <hi>time</hi> when he ſhall <hi>return</hi> from <hi>the warfare of the ſervice.</hi> Among the many <hi>oppoſite times</hi> for many buſineſſes, the Wiſeman tells us of a <hi>time for war, and a time for peace, Eccleſ.</hi> 3.8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>proper time</hi> of <hi>returning, ceaſing,</hi> and <hi>reſting</hi> from the ſpiritual <hi>warfare,</hi> is the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Where the <hi>Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</hi> And this is the <hi>time</hi> hinted and figured in the text before us; the age of fifty years. Which, if we render according to the Hebrew, word for word, they ſound thus, <hi>From a ſon of fifty years;</hi> that is, from a <hi>ſon born of the ſpirit,</hi> figured by the <hi>number fifty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For thus in type the <hi>Levites,</hi> the <hi>Kohathites, Gerſhonites,</hi> and <hi>Merarites,</hi> although, for diverſe reaſons, already ſhewen, they

And from fifty years of their age, they muſt <hi>return</hi> from the <hi>warfare</hi> of the <hi>ſervice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More particularly; as <hi>fourty years</hi> is the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>ſeparation, trial of faith, &amp; obedience, the time of ſin, puniſhment of ſin, &amp; humiliation and repentance, and mortification of ſin,</hi> as I ſhall ſhortly ſhew if the Lord will. So the number of <hi>fifty</hi> notes <hi>remiſsion</hi> and <hi>pardon,</hi> yea, <hi>doing away of ſin.</hi> Whence it was, that the 50 year was the year of <hi>Jubile,</hi> the year of <hi>Releaſe,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. It is very often in that Chapter called <gap reason="foreign">

The time when they who have mortified their ſins are born from the dead, and become born of the Spirit. Thus when <hi>David</hi> had now <hi>fought</hi> the Lords <hi>battles, Solomon</hi> his ſon ſucceeded him, a man of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. We may note from hence, the Lords gracious dealing with thoſe who <hi>labour in his ſervice.</hi> The Levites who had <hi>laboured</hi> twenty years in <hi>bearing burdens,</hi> beſides five years ſpent in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to their <hi>warfare,</hi> had a time when they were <hi>milites emeriti,</hi> as ſouldiers diſcharged from <hi>warring the warfare of the ſervice,</hi> when they muſt <hi>ſerve</hi> no more, but <hi>miniſter</hi> with their brethren in the Tabernacle of the meeting, to keep the charge, and ſhall do no ſervice, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.25.26.

And did the Lord wholly neglect his Evangelical Levites, when their ſtrength faileth them? Surely no: Liberal maintenance was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them, whereby their old age might be cheriſhed, after their hard duty performed.</p>
               <p>But when the Goſpell Levites made the people ſtumble at Gods Law as impoſſible to be kept, or, (which amounts to the like) not belonging to thoſe under the Goſpel; when they <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the covenant of Levi, Mal.</hi> 2.8. when the people <hi>enlarged their deſire like hell, Habak.</hi> 2.5. The Levite now paſt his labour, is as much regarded as an <hi>old Horſe</hi> which hath <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>reſt</hi> only when he is <hi>dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is a remedileſs complaint, when what was provided and <hi>conſecrated</hi> unto the ſupport of the aged Levites, is diverted unto <hi>other,</hi> and thoſe (to ſpeak <hi>moſt ſparingly</hi>) whrſe ends.</p>
               <p>May not the conſideration of this, ſhame us who pretend our ſelves to be ſpiritual <hi>Levites,</hi> ſuch as <hi>cleave unto the Lord</hi> (they

Thus the Lord <hi>meeteth him</hi> who rejoyceth and worketh righteouſneſs, <hi>Eſay</hi> 64.5.</p>
               <p>But when the Levites <hi>ſtrength is ſpent in warring the warfare of the Lord,</hi> muſt the Levites then be idle? Surely no: they muſt now <hi>miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no part of <hi>time</hi> that wholly exempts any man from <hi>ſerving</hi> God.

               <p>The reaſon of this exact obſervation of <hi>time</hi> for the <hi>killing of the Paſsover,</hi> was, that there might be a due correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

               <p>For, whereas the Jewes divided their day into twelve hours, (which they made longer or ſhorter, according to the divers parts of the year,) ſo ſaith our Lord, <hi>Are there not welve hours in the day? John</hi> 11.9. at the <hi>third hour,</hi> that is, our nine a clock in the morning, they offered up the <hi>Morning Sacrifice, a perfect Lamb;</hi> and <hi>betwetn the two Evenings, about our three a clock after noon,</hi> they offered up the <hi>Evening Sacrifice, Exod.</hi> 29.38.39. <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.3.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe things befel that people in <hi>figure,</hi> and were written for our <hi>admonition,</hi> that we might the better be confirmed and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>true Paſchal Lamb,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>the true daily ſacrifice, that Lamb of God who takes away the ſins of the world, John</hi> 1. For as, among the many lawes touching the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb,</hi> this was one, which was obſerved in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 19.26. <hi>A bone of him ſhall not be broken;</hi> and therefore they brake not his legs, as they did theirs who were crucified with him: So like charge is given, in the Scripture before us, concerning the <hi>time,</hi> when Chriſt <hi>our Paſsover</hi> was <hi>ſacrificed</hi> for us; which is obſerved very punctually by the Evangeliſt <hi>S. Mark,</hi> Chap. 15.25. <hi>It was the third hour, when they crucified him:</hi> the uſual <hi>hour</hi> of the <hi>Morning Sacrifice,</hi> (although, that <hi>time</hi> might be allowed to other Sacrifices, which by no means, might precede this, the <hi>Morning Sacrifice</hi> was ſometime offered more early.) The ſame Evangeliſt ſaith, that at the <hi>ninth hour,</hi> (or three a clock after noon, the time of the <hi>Evening Sacrifice,</hi> unleſs it did ſomewhat anticipate, for the reaſon above named,) at that ſame <hi>ninth hour</hi> Jeſus cryed with a lowd voice, and gave up the ghoſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.34.37.</p>
               <p>All which, although it be very well worth our obſervation, and may be a good ſubject for our meditations to buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about, eſpecially the <hi>Paſsion week now inſtant,</hi> yet I believe, there is ſomewhat of neerer concernment unto us, which may hence be taken notice of; without which, all our meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about Chriſt crucified <hi>without us,</hi> ſo many hundred years ago, will very little avail us toward our ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Surely as we are <hi>with the Lord the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> ſo is he with us, as I have lately ſhewen. If therefore we <hi>decline from our obedience,</hi> become <hi>Apoſtates</hi> unto the <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>turn</hi> from the Lord, and follow the <hi>Prince of darkneſs,</hi> and will do his luſts, theſe are two <hi>ſpiritual evenings,</hi> between which, the <hi>Paskal Lamb is ſlain.</hi> Which are the very ſame with that of the School; that

               <p>According to this diſtinction, we may reconcile the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle:</hi> who indeed differ not but only ſeemingly. We read <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 10.12. that the <hi>beginning</hi> of pride is when one <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from God,</hi> and his heart is <hi>turned away from his Maker:</hi> For <hi>pride is the beginning of ſin, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>Quoad averſionem à Deo,</hi> ſo far forth as a man, through pride, (which is an high opinion of a mans own excellency,) <hi>turns away</hi> from God.

               <p>But the ancient Fathers, <hi>S.

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:65717:235"/>out of Egypt, &amp;c.</hi> His leading them thorow the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Many have applyed this portion of Scripture unto Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his appearing in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> as <hi>Salomon,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.41. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 68. Others, as the Ancients before named have made uſe of it unto Chriſt, as to his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> that thereby he might prove himſelf to be God; <hi>Let God ariſe, and ſo evidence himſelf to the Son of God by his reſurrection from the dead, Rom.</hi> 1.4. And <hi>let his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be ſcattered,</hi> that is, ſay they, the Jewes who ſaid, we will not have this man to reign over us, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. And indeed they have been ſo ſcattered as never nation but themſelves have been. Others underſtand <hi>his enemies</hi> to be <hi>other wicked men.</hi> Others yet hereby will have the <hi>Devils to be meant.</hi> And therefore <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaith of <hi>Antony</hi> the <hi>Monk,</hi> that when he was aſſaulted by the <hi>Devil,</hi> he made uſe of thoſe two firſt verſes of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 68. parallel to <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.35. And there is no doubt but ſoveraign uſe may be made of this Scripture upon every <hi>aſſault and temptation of the evil one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this is enlarged to men of contrary mindes to us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jewes, Turks, or Chriſtians by profeſſion, too often men out of <hi>ſelf-love partially endear themſelves,</hi> or fanſie themſelves to be endeared unto Chriſt, as his <hi>friends,</hi> and, out of private hatred, conceive others, whom they hate, to be the <hi>enemies of God and Chriſt,</hi> when its poſſible to be quite otherwiſe. Yet hence ariſe debates, contentions, enmities, and moſt wars among <hi>pretending Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Meantime its little underſtood and leſs regarded, that the <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal minde is an enemy againſt God; that the friendſhip of this world, is an enemy againſt God;</hi> Gods <hi>enemies</hi> are out <hi>fleſhly luſts which fight againſt our ſouls, &amp;c.</hi> O how needful is it to pray unto the Lord, that he would <hi>ariſe up in us</hi> and <hi>ſcatter theſe,</hi> which are <hi>his and our trueſt enemies!</hi> and that they who hate him and us, may flee <hi>from his wrathful face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the Lords works as to <hi>ſcatter his enemies,</hi> even all out <hi>carnal luſts,</hi> and the <hi>ſpiritualities</hi> of wickedneſs, ſo likewiſe is it his work to cauſe <hi>to return, gather,</hi> and <hi>unite</hi> all his <hi>ſcattered friends,</hi> his ten thouſands thouſands of Iſrael, to one another, and to himſelf, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn himſelf unto the ten thouſands thouſands of Iſrael. That is the ſecond object of <hi>Moſes</hi> his prayer. For ſo largely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the word here uſed may ſignifie: And, thus the latter part of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>prayer</hi> may be two wayes underſtood. 1. <hi>Return</hi> O Lord the ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſands of Iſrael to one another, and to thy ſelf. 2. (By a Supplement,) <hi>Return,</hi> O Lord <hi>unto</hi> the ten thouſands thouſands of Iſrael. The ſenſes are both good; our Tranſlators take notice only of the latter.</p>
               <pb n="436" facs="tcp:65717:236"/>
               <p>The former work is the cauſing all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>return</hi> one to other, and to himſelf: The later is the Lords <hi>return</hi> unto his Iſrael ſo <hi>returned</hi> and gathered one to other, and to himſelf. Theſe are two great acts of Gods grace and favour toward his people.</p>
               <p>The former, the Lord accompliſheth by <hi>Eliah</hi> the <hi>Tisbite,</hi> that is, the <hi>Turner, who cauſeth to return;</hi> according to what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith of him, That he ſhall <hi>turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to the fathers, Mal.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p>This may occaſion a long, but no impertinent diſcourſe. Our Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.11, 12. diſtinguiſheth a twofold <hi>coming</hi> of <hi>Eliah</hi> the <hi>Tisbite.</hi> One <hi>Eliah,</hi> ſaith he, is <hi>already come;</hi> the other, <hi>ſhall come.</hi> Theſe two <hi>comings</hi> of <hi>Eliah</hi> anſwer to the two <hi>comings</hi> of Chriſt; 1. In the <hi>fleſh:</hi> 2. In the <hi>Spirit.</hi> So that before each <hi>coming</hi> of our Lord, we read an expreſs promiſe of his <hi>fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Mal.</hi> 3.1. and 4.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eliah</hi> in his firſt <hi>coming</hi> was courſly entertaind by <hi>Herod, Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> and <hi>Salome, Matth.</hi> 14. That <hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>Tisbite</hi> is yet <hi>to come,</hi> is much oppoſed by many who endeavour to confound our Lords words, as that they were to be underſtood of <hi>one Elias,</hi> and one <hi>coming</hi> of that <hi>Elias.</hi> Againſt this, I oppoſe the very context: our Lord ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Elias cometh</hi> or <hi>ſhall come,</hi> and <hi>ſhall reſtore</hi> all <hi>things.</hi> But Ver. 12. he ſaith, I ſay unto you, that <hi>Elias</hi> is already come. How can theſe be underſtood otherwiſe then either of a <hi>twofold Elias,</hi> or at leaſt of a <hi>two-fold coming</hi> of <hi>one Elias?</hi> If further proof of this be needful, both Jewes and Chriſtians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the fourth of <hi>Malachy</hi> ver. 6. of <hi>Elia's</hi> ſecond <hi>coming</hi> in the end of the world. Thus the Jewes ſay of <hi>Elias</hi> that he muſt appear to Iſrael in their banniſhment, to <hi>bring them again into their own land.</hi> And therefore when they adminiſter circumciſion, they ſet an empty chair for <hi>Elias,</hi> wherein, ſome ſay, he ſits invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly. And as the Jewes teſtifie this, ſo the Fathers alſo of the Greek and Latin Church, underſtand our Saviour to ſpeak of the <hi>ſecond coming</hi> of Chriſt, and the <hi>coming of Elias before him.</hi> Thus <hi>S. Cyril, Chryſoſtom, Theodoret, Euthymius, Tertullian, Hilary, Anſelm, Hugo, Lyra, Tho. Aquinas, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And reaſon there is both in regard of Gods promiſe by <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.6. and our Lords prediction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.11, 12. and a kinde of neceſſity in regard of Chriſt, and they who are Chriſts. 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Chriſt: for if Chriſt <hi>coming in the fleſh</hi> muſt have a <gap reason="foreign">

In regard of thoſe who are Chriſts; for if that handful of men in <hi>Judea</hi> needed an <hi>Elias,</hi> how much more all the ten Tribes <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 48.10.

               <p>Since <hi>Moſes</hi> prayes, that the Lord would <hi>return, reduce,</hi> and <hi>reſtore</hi> the ten thouſands thouſands of Iſrael, it appears that Iſrael for the preſent, is in an <hi>averſe</hi> and evil ſtate, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> praies for a <hi>change</hi> unto a good condition.</p>
               <p>The <hi>averſe</hi> and evil ſtate of Iſrael, from which <hi>Moſes</hi> prayes for a <hi>change</hi> to be made, ſuppoſeth a former good condition, wherein Iſrael had been; and from which they had been <hi>depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> and <hi>corrupted.</hi> So that the office of <hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>Tisbite</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends three things; whereof two ſuppoſed the third expreſſed: the firſt ſuppoſed is, That all things with Iſrael, <hi>have been</hi> in a good ſtate. 2.

                  <hi>Elias</hi> muſt <hi>rectifie</hi> the <hi>depravation</hi> of all things. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> whom our Lord called <hi>Elias,</hi> began this work, as much as befitted <hi>his diſpenſation,</hi> as the <hi>Prodromus</hi> or forerunner of Chriſt in the fleſh. The other <hi>Elias</hi> was to <hi>return</hi> and <hi>reſtore all things:</hi> He was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the worſhip of God, to act the part of old <hi>Elias</hi> over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And ſince <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> could not <hi>waſh away Baal</hi> &amp; his Prieſts; the later <hi>Elias</hi> muſt <hi>fire</hi> them out of Iſrael. <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts offer their ſacrifices <hi>without fire,</hi> and teach, that the <hi>ſin muſt remain unconſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;</hi> and <hi>that its impoſsible, it ſhould be conſumed in this world. Elias</hi> prayes for <hi>fire</hi> from heaven, even <hi>the holy Spirit</hi> of God, which is as <hi>fire;</hi> and that <hi>conſumes the ſacrifice upon the altar of Chriſts pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> even the <hi>body of ſin</hi> that is to be deſtroyed. Yea, it licks up the <hi>water,</hi> all the <hi>tranſitory delights and pleaſures in ſin.</hi> It conſumes the <hi>ſtones,</hi> the <hi>hardneſs of the heart;</hi> and the <hi>duſt</hi> the <hi>knowing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> which is the <hi>Serpents food, Eſay</hi> 65.25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Elias</hi> muſt deſtroy the <hi>painted Jezabel,</hi> which puts <hi>Naboth</hi> to death by the authority of <hi>Ahab.</hi> And does not <hi>Jezabel</hi> yet act the ſame part? <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.22. that earthly lying ſpirit of the falſe righteouſneſs in the mouth of the falſe Prophets, which, by the power and authority of Kings, Princes, and Governours, by the ſecular power in all ages, and in this laſt part of time, puts <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi> to death by falſe witneſſes. For what is <hi>Naboth</hi> but the <hi>true Propheſie?</hi> as the word ſignifieth. And thus at this day, the falſe Prieſts of <hi>Jezebel</hi> by their falſe teſtimonies, ſuppreſs the <hi>true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of God,</hi> who have the <hi>teſtimony of Jeſus, which is the ſpirit of propheſie, Revel.</hi> 19.10.</p>
               <p>This therefore is <hi>Elia's</hi> work to diſcover <hi>Jezebel,</hi> the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets adorn'd with falſe holineſs; and to anoint <hi>Jehu</hi> a type of Chriſt, <hi>(who was, is, and is to come)</hi> and ſhall cauſe her to be troden under foot of his army, as the old <hi>Jezebel</hi> was.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Elias</hi> muſt <hi>rectifie</hi> the worſhip of God; ſo muſt he <hi>ſet in order the man toward his neighbour.</hi> He muſt <hi>turn the heart of the fathers to the children,</hi> and the children to their fathers. He ſhall put an end to all differences between the <hi>ſpiritual fathers</hi> and <hi>their children;</hi> and the ſpirits of the <hi>later Prophets,</hi> ſhall be ſubject to the <hi>former Prophets. Cum Elias venerit, ſolvet nodos, When Elias comes,</hi> he ſhall <hi>untye all knots, reſolve all doubts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, he ſhall <hi>bring back</hi> the whole man unto his God. He ſhall <hi>restore</hi> the <hi>natural man</hi> to his <hi>right,</hi> and the <hi>heavenly man to his.</hi> He ſhall <hi>recover all Edom</hi> to the <hi>houſe of Iſrael, Obad. v.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>And great reaſon there is; 1. The honour of the <hi>God of Order.</hi> His Wiſdom, Juſtice, Power, and Goodneſs herein is eminently ſeen. How much more when all, what ever is amiſs, is <hi>rectified</hi> and <hi>brought to right again?</hi> 2. It is the office of <hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>Tisbite</hi> ſo to do, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.5. LXX.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The Lord ſaid of <hi>Caleb,</hi> that he was his ſervant. What <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb</hi> was, we read, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. What is it to be the Lords <hi>ſervant?</hi> Generally, his ſervants ye are, whom ye obey, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. And what is it to obey? what elſe but pliably and willingly to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ones own will to the fulfilling of anothers will? 1. Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt be pliable and willing, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.19. 2. It muſt be to the command of another as ſuch. For if the natural bent of ones own will, be to the ſame act which another commands, without reſpect had to the command, as ſuch, it is <hi>nulla vel minor,</hi> either no obedience at all, or leſs, ſaith <hi>S. Gregory.</hi> Becauſe obedience properly reſpects the fulfilling, not of our own, but of anothers will. For example, <hi>Jer.</hi> 35.6, 7. Had the ſons of <hi>Rechab</hi> been <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally abstemious,</hi> and loved no wine, their obedience to their father had been either <hi>ſo much the leſs,</hi> or <hi>indeed none at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When therefore the Lord faith of <hi>Caleb,</hi> that he was his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, it is to be underſtood that he was obedient, that is, that he was willing and pliable to the fulfilling of the Lords will.</p>
               <p>That we may the better underſtand this, we muſt know, that there is a great difference between <hi>doing that which is the will of the Lord, and being obedient unto the will of the Lord.</hi> For we may do that which is the <hi>will of the Lord:</hi> 1. As <hi>natural</hi> agents, not as <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary:</hi> Thus the <hi>Egyptians</hi> lent the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> their Gold &amp; Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els at their departure out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as natural agents: for <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly</hi> they would never have 1. disfurniſhed themſelves; 2. lent their goods to thoſe whom they ſhould never ſee again; 3. and arm'd their enemies againſt themſelves. 2. As <hi>voluntary agents;</hi> yet not doing the will of the Lord <hi>voluntarily</hi> and <hi>willingly;</hi> but either executing <hi>their own evil wils,</hi> as <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did what the hand and counſel of God determined before to be done, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.28. 3. Or doing what is the <hi>will of the Lord out of fear;</hi> as <hi>Laban</hi> hurt not <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Gen.</hi> 31.29. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> let the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> depart out of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>Balaam</hi> did not curſe but bleſſed <hi>Iſrael, Numb.</hi> 24. 4. Or elſe they do the <hi>will of the Lord out of hope of reward and ſelf-ſeeking.</hi> Thus the falſe Prophet propheſied for hire. Some <hi>Saducies</hi> lived orderly <hi>out of hope of temporal bleſsings.</hi> The <hi>Phariſees made long prayers,</hi> and <hi>gave almes,</hi> and did all they did <hi>to be ſeen of men.</hi> All theſe and many the like do the ſame thing, <hi>which God wills</hi> to be done; but none of them can be ſaid to be <hi>genuine ſervants, and obedient unto the Lord.</hi>

               <p>Surely they are all out and miſs of the main drift of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in this phraſe which is often uſed, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.36. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 14.8.9.—14. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.6.

                  <hi>He fulfilled;</hi> whereas indeed therein is intimated the meaning of this phraſe, where the object, ſubject, or thing to be <hi>fulfilled,</hi> is underſtood, which is no other then the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of God, and <hi>Calebs</hi> own <hi>duty.</hi> And ſo <hi>Vatablus</hi> explains it, <hi>Implevit voluntatem meam ſequendo me,</hi> he <hi>fulfilled my will</hi> in following me; which laſt words might be ſpared, as I ſhall ſhew anon: <hi>Munſter</hi> alſo expounds it, <hi>Implevit ſubaudi verbum vel voluntatem, meam,</hi> he <hi>fulfilled, underſtand, my word or will.

               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Caleb</hi> is ſaid to <hi>fulfil</hi> and <hi>do</hi> the <hi>will</hi> of the Lord <hi>after him,</hi> the Lord is ſuppoſed to have <hi>fulfilled the ſame will before him.</hi> But how is this to be underſtood? I ſhewed before that theſe words are to be underſtood as ſpoken by the Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>That we may the better underſtand this, we muſt know, that, what God Almighty <hi>wills,</hi> he either <hi>himſelf wills</hi> and <hi>does,</hi> or elſe he <hi>wills,</hi> that it be <hi>done by others, Pſal.</hi> 135.6. whatſoever the Lord pleaſed, <hi>he did</hi> in heaven and earth, in the ſeas and in all depths.

               </p>
               <p>But is not <hi>[word]</hi> or <hi>[will]</hi> or <hi>[duty]</hi> as bold a <hi>ſupplement,</hi> as <hi>[fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed?]</hi> Surely it is not. For we read no ſuch expreſſion in the holy Scripture, as <hi>fully to follow,</hi> which this phraſe is made to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie. But what phraſes are more ordinary then <hi>fulfilling the word of the Lord, his Law, his Commandements, fulfilling righteouſneſs, &amp;c.</hi> But in the ſenſe which our Tranſlators and others make of theſe words, they render the verb <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:65717:252"/>
                  <hi>to over come,</hi> is often uſed alone, and no object named; but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as known. How often read we this phraſe in the ſecond and third chapters of the Revelation? To him <hi>that overcometh,</hi> I will give to eat of the tree of life, &amp;c. He that <hi>overcommeth</hi> ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death. Where, and elſewhere we read an <hi>act</hi> exhorted unto, without any <hi>object</hi> added; yet to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of every ſuch <hi>act</hi> and <hi>duty,</hi> there is a reſpective <hi>reward</hi> annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>object</hi> to be <hi>overcome</hi> is the old <hi>Serpent</hi> and <hi>his temptations:</hi> Which may be underſtood from the firſt enmity put between the holy <hi>ſeed</hi> or Chriſt, and the <hi>Serpent</hi> and their <hi>ſeeds,</hi> as alſo from the frequent combates between them thorowout the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And the like <hi>defect</hi> may eaſily be ſupplied, where <hi>Caleb</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>fulfilled,</hi> others, not to have <hi>fulfilled,</hi> that is; the law, will, or commandment of the Lord, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 14.8, 9. <hi>Num.</hi> 32.11, 12. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.6.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. The <hi>will, word,</hi> and <hi>law</hi> of God is to be <hi>fulfilled.</hi> The law of God is <hi>practical,</hi> and conſiſts of duties to be <hi>done</hi> by us, not <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> or fanſied to be <hi>done</hi> already for us. How often may we read this? <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.25. obſerve to do all his commandements, and 15.5. and 19.9. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.14.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt hath not ſo <hi>fulfilled</hi> the law for us, as to exempt us from <hi>fulfilling</hi> it <hi>after him,</hi> in <hi>him</hi> and <hi>through him.</hi> For what the law could not do; in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſent his Son in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſin in the fleſh, that <hi>the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us</hi> who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. Beſide, when the Lord ſaith, as its ſuppoſed, that the Lord hath done the work himſelf, ſo hence its required to be done by us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This will of the Father, as the Son <hi>fulfils</hi> after him, ſo the
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:65717:253"/>believers alſo in the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son fulfill</hi> the will of the Father and Son, after them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1. Be ye <hi>imitators</hi> of God as dear children and walk in love, as Chriſt loved us, &amp;c. And as the Father <hi>doth loving kindneſs, judgement and righteouſneſs,</hi> ſo doth the <hi>Son</hi> after the Father, and ſo ought we after the Son, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.15. It becometh us to <hi>fulfil</hi> all righteouſneſs. So his will is, that we <hi>love one another,</hi> as he hath <hi>loved us;</hi> and the like is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of other duties.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hence it appears, that the will of God revealed unto men, is a <hi>rule</hi> of their life, and is not only <hi>poſitive,</hi> as that whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs depends only upon the authority of God, and therefore good only, <hi>becauſe God commands it;</hi> as the ceremonial law is therefore <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe it is commanded of the <hi>moſt holy</hi> God. But the law of God to be <hi>fulfilled</hi> by us, is <hi>therefore commanded</hi> by God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in it ſelf, and in its <hi>own nature, holy, juſt,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and ſuch as God the Father himſelf <hi>practiſeth, Jer.</hi> 9.24. that which the <hi>Son of God fulfils after him,</hi> that which the <hi>holy Angels fulfil after the Son of God, Pſal.</hi> 103.20. Ye Angels mighty in ſtrength, who do his commandments, hearkning to the voice of his word. That which all believing and obedient <hi>men fulfil after God.</hi> This is that <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> which <hi>David</hi> ſaith, is an <hi>everlaſting righteouſneſs.</hi> And theſe are the <hi>words</hi> of God which are for ever <hi>ſetled in heaven, Pſalm</hi> 119.89. So that they who think ſlightly of the <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of God, as if they were <hi>arbitrary</hi> and left to our diſcretion to be fulfilled or left undone, they fouly deceive themſelves, and that in a matter of the greateſt weight; ſince God himſelf, the Son of God, all good Angels, all good men have <hi>fulfilled after God,</hi> what God himſelf <hi>hath done.</hi> So that when men neglect to <hi>fulfil after the Lord,</hi> and rather <hi>fulfil their own luſts,</hi> they <hi>fulfil</hi> after <hi>their father the devil,</hi> and his <hi>ſon of perdition, through the ſpirit of errour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O ye <hi>ſervants</hi> of the Lord who are of <hi>another,</hi> of a <hi>new ſpirit,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>faith and courage,</hi> let us <hi>fulfil</hi> after the Lord, let us <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the will and word of God after him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which much hinders this important duty, is a prejudice conceived againſt it. We have been wonted unto ſuch doctrine, as <hi>mákes void</hi> the law of God; as if Chriſt had ſo <hi>fulfilled</hi> the law of God for us, that he fulfilled not the ſame in us; which is contrary to his own aſſertion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.15. and 5.17.—20. and his Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12. and many other Scriptures.</p>

The like was prefigured in the manifold obſtacles and impediments which hindred this people in their journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the land of promiſe, whereof ye read in the two former books, and in the firſt part of this book.</p>
               <p>The greateſt obſtruction in their way was the diffidence and deſpair of the people, and afterward their vain confidence and preſumption.</p>
               <p>The Text contains Gods ſentence againſt the Apoſtates from the faith. Whereof there are two parts:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their puniſhment denounced. 2. The cauſe intimated.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Their puniſhment denounced; ye ſhall bear your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. Which is amplified by the time; fourty years: and that in proportion to the time wherein they ſearched the land; fourty dayes, a day for a year.</p>

               <p n="3">3. The time of ſearching the land was fourty days.

The Lord Jeſus was tempted fourty dayes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.1, 2. 2. The faith and obedience of the people was tryed fourty dayes, while <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the Mount: While the Spies ſearched the land. 3. Its a time of ſin.

<pb n="489" facs="tcp:65717:259"/>that ſins ſake they bare their puniſhment fourty years. 5.

               <p>The reaſon why they <hi>ſearched</hi> the land, will appear from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the <hi>land</hi> it ſelf, and the <hi>ſearchers</hi> of it; their <hi>deſigne</hi> &amp; Gods <hi>authority</hi> for the <hi>ſearching</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>land</hi> it ſelf flowed with Milk and Honey, and was the glory of all lands, and therefore well worth the <hi>ſearching.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. Beſide, the Lord, out of confidence that the goodneſs of the land would anſwer his teſtimony given concerning it; and would ſatisfie their moſt curious <hi>inquiſition</hi> and <hi>ſearch</hi> of it, he yielded to their importunity, and ordered the <hi>ſearching</hi> of it. All which howſoever moſt true; yet hereby the Lord approves not of their <hi>ſearching</hi> the land, but in theſe words tacitly reproves them for their <hi>ſearching</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Does the Lord blame them for <hi>ſearching the</hi> Land? Does not he himſelf appoint <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſend men, and direct him who they ſhould be? <hi>Num.</hi> 13.2. It is true; but the Original of this <hi>ſearch</hi> was the peoples <hi>curioſity</hi> and their <hi>prying</hi> and <hi>ſearching providence, Deut.</hi> 1.22. Unto which notwithſtanding the Lord condeſcended out of ſecurity and confidence, that the Land would prove wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy their approbation. Thus the Lord condeſcended unto the peoples deſires of making themſelves a King; though he gave them that King in his wrath, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.11.</p>
               <p>So here its evident, that the Lord layes ſome blame upon the people for <hi>ſearching the</hi> Land.

                  </gap>, which is, commonly here underſtood Metonymically, as the effect put for the cauſe. But I ſee no reaſon but hereby we may underſtand the <hi>iniquity it ſelf,</hi> or the guilt of it. For howſoever the Lord, at the interceſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> had remitted the everlaſting puniſhment, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.20. Yet might they be made to feel the burden of their ſin, according as the Lord threatens in my text. And <hi>Num.</hi> 27.3.

               <p n="3">3. According to the dayes wherein they <hi>ſearched the land,</hi> even <hi>fourty dayes,</hi> each day for a year, they ſhall <hi>bear their iniquities even fourty years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of this ſeeming great exceſs of puniſhment, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſin is not to be looked at according to the <hi>time</hi> wherein it is acted, but 1. According to the <hi>perſon offended.</hi> 2. According to the holy and juſt <hi>law violated,</hi> and the juſt <hi>penalty</hi> of that law. 3.

Thus he dealt with <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> with <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and with his own people.</p>
               <p>The moſt juſt and merciful God in his puniſhments uſually <hi>goes leſs,</hi> and not to the full extent of his threatnings. Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who have exactly counted the years of Iſraels puniſhment in the Wilderneſs, they finde it to fall ſhort ſome moneths of <hi>full fourty years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the holy people, who ought to be like their God, being commanded not to exceed <hi>fourty ſtripes,</hi> for the greateſt fault, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.3. They Commonly, out of equity, remitted at leaſt

               <p>But in beſtowing of rewards, the mercifull God uſually <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds</hi> his promiſes, <hi>Eſay</hi> 35. Where the Lord foretells what miracles the Son of God ſhould work, in the dayes of his fleſh, we read not of caſting out Devills, nor curing the lepers; both which we read frequently done by him.</p>
               <p>The Lord promiſed David, that after he ſhould ſleep with his fathers, his Son ſhould ſit upon his throne, but he brought that to paſs while <hi>David</hi> was yet a live, and his eyes ſeeing it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence it appears, that the <hi>ſin of a day,</hi> may bring on us <hi>a years puniſhment,</hi> yea many years; yea, an eternity, if not timely repented of and forſaken.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>quadrageſima</hi> of ſin may bring a <hi>quadringenteſsimum,</hi> yea a <hi>ſeculum,</hi> yea a <hi>ſeculum ſeculorum,</hi> of Judgement.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence it followes, that there is an <hi>everlaſting puniſhment</hi> remaining for incorrigible and impenitent diſobedient men. This is evident from hence, becauſe the Lord remitted and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned this people their ſin, as appears, <hi>Num.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. Yet here the Lord denounceth a <hi>puniſhment</hi> againſt the ſame ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Its clear therefore, that, when God hath <hi>forgiven ſin,</hi> as to the <hi>everlaſting puniſhment,</hi> He may and often doth <hi>reſerve a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</hi> This is evident as out of the text, ſo by <hi>Nahans</hi> tranſactions with <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon is; becauſe there is no ſin, unles timely repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, but its deadly. So ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 46.28. I will cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe thee in <hi>meaſure</hi> and not leave thee wholly unpuniſhed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By this means he works further repentance and humiliation in the party ſinning. 2. It renders the ſinner more cautious and wary for the time to come; becauſe the rod of Gods correction is upon him. 3. It declares, that there is a God that judgeth the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.11. 4. It is for example unto others that they may hear, and fear, and do no more wickedly. 5. We learn hence, that the <hi>Purgatory</hi> and <hi>temporal puniſhment</hi> for ſin, may be ſafely admitted in this life. 6. Hence its evident, that ſome are judged here, that they may not periſh with the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. for the deſtruction of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that the <hi>ſpirit</hi> may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the day of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This reproves their erroneous judgement who think, that, becauſe God puniſhes men here a <hi>long time,</hi> therefore he will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them <hi>for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe who conclude, that they may ſin <hi>impunè,</hi> becauſe they ſee no hurt come of it for the <hi>preſent.</hi> Its impoſſible, but that they ſhould be puniſhed for it either <hi>temporally</hi> or <hi>eternally.</hi>

When ever it was, or by whomſoever it was firſt inſtituted, ſure I am, he wanted not a patern in the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>Our Lords example unto us is above all other, who <hi>faſted fourty dayes and fourty nights, Matth.</hi> 4.2. which was prefigured by <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 34.28. and <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.8. who appeared with him in his transfiguration, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.3. What if we produce a downright precept of Chriſt for Chriſtians <hi>fasting?</hi> Ye ſhall finde it recorded in three of the Evangeliſts, <hi>Matthew</hi> 9.14, 15. <hi>Mark</hi> 2.18, 19, 20. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.33, 34, 35. where the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> and of the Phariſees move this queſtion to our Lord; why do the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> and of the Phariſees <hi>faſt,</hi> but thy Diſciples <hi>faſt</hi> not? Our Lord anſwers this queſtion; 1. Why, for the preſent, his Diſciples could not <hi>fast;</hi> They were children of the <hi>Bride-chamber,</hi> and as yet the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was with them, therefore they could not <hi>fast.</hi> 2. He gives command to his Diſciples for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, that they ſhould <hi>faſt;</hi> and gives reaſon for it. The dayes ſhall come, when the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> ſhall be taken away from them; and then ſhall they <hi>faſt in thoſe dayes.</hi> We read no where, that our Lord ever repealed or annulled this precept. This precept therefore muſt ſtand firm, at leaſt while the reaſon of it ſtands firm.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore inquire concerning the marriage between Chriſt and his Church: and whether the heavenly <hi>Bridegroom</hi> be with us yea or no?

Ye <hi>tithe</hi> Mint and <hi>Dill</hi> and Cummin, and omit the more weighty things of the law, <hi>judgment, mercy</hi> and <hi>ſaith;</hi> Theſe things <hi>ye ought</hi> to have done, (namely, judgment, mercy and faith;) <hi>and not to leave the other,</hi> (that is, <hi>tithing of Mint, Dill and Cummin,</hi>) <hi>undone.</hi> I never in my miniſtry hitherto have preached for <hi>tithes,</hi> or any other <hi>maintenance</hi> of the miniſters; though the holy Scripture, yea, the New Teſtament be full of arguments leading that way, (and men who read Scripture, might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, did not ſelf love blind them.) But becauſe they are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>covetous</hi> who ſpeak of ſuch a ſubject; as alſo becauſe I have endeavoured to <hi>win the peoples ſouls unto God, and not ſought mine own gain,</hi> as God is witneſs, I have therefore forborn that <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Howbeit I know not how it is poſſible for any man, how oppoſit ſoever he be unto <hi>Tithes,</hi> to avoid that reaſon which is immediately and undenyably deduced out of our Lords words. Adde what the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7.—15. and any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man will obſerve, that what places out of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, they uſe againſt the miniſters maintenance by <hi>Tithes,</hi> or other like way, they underſtand and urge <hi>fallaciouſly</hi> by a known <hi>fallacy à dicto ſecundum quid, ad dictum ſimpliciter.</hi> Becauſe he took no main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> therefore none of any other; If follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</p>
               <p>By occaſion of that place in <hi>S. Matthew</hi> miſtranſlated, I have
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:65717:275"/>made ſomewhat a long, but, I hope, not an unprofitable digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Let us now proceed unto a third argument.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If <hi>Ezob</hi> be not that which we call <hi>Hyſſop,</hi> what then is it? There are diverſe conjectures what Ezob ſhould be. Some ſay, its <hi>Adiantum, Maidenhair,</hi> or <hi>Ruta muraria, Rue of the wall.</hi> Others, <hi>Parietaria, Pellitory of the wall.</hi> Which conceits ſeem to be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on what I cited before out of 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.33. where <hi>Ezob</hi> is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  <hi>growing in, or by, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wall,</hi> not <hi>out</hi> of the wall, as ours render it. And ſo it is true, that the <hi>herbs</hi> above named grow <hi>out of the wall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I rather think, that by <hi>Ezob</hi> is here to be underſtood <hi>Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notis</hi> or <hi>Roſmarinus,</hi> which we call <hi>Roſmary;</hi> as being that, unto which the deſcription, vertue and uſe of <hi>Ezob</hi> very well agree.</p>
               <p>As for the deſcription, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.33. it contains the <hi>genus</hi> or <hi>common nature</hi> of Eſob, and the ſubject place where it beſt grows and thrives. As for the <hi>genus</hi> or <hi>common nature,</hi> its reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>trees,</hi> and the <hi>loweſt</hi> of them; as appears by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of it with the <hi>Cedar,</hi> which is the <hi>talleſt.</hi> And <hi>as a tree,</hi> its of a <hi>woody</hi> ſubſtance, as <gap reason="foreign">

Behold it is caſt into the <hi>fire</hi> for <hi>fewel;</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> devoureth both the ends of it; and the midſt of it is <hi>burnt,</hi> will it <hi>proſper for work?</hi> It is evident unto any underſtanding man who ſhall attentively conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this place, that the Lord ſpeaks not of the <hi>Vine tree,</hi> as our Tranſlators turn it, but of the <hi>wood of that tree</hi> now <hi>ſere</hi> and <hi>dry;</hi> and ſuch as in other <hi>trees</hi> now <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>ſeaſoned,</hi> they make <hi>timber,</hi> and apply to ſome <hi>work,</hi> as here the Prophet inſtanceth, to make a <hi>Pin;</hi> which men are not wont to do, while the <hi>tree</hi> is <hi>green;</hi> nor uſually while it is <hi>green,</hi> do they <hi>burn it.</hi> But as for the Vine, when the <hi>wood of it is now dry,</hi> men uſe not it for any <hi>work,</hi> nor make a <hi>Pin</hi> of it, but then burn it, as good for nothing elſe. As our Lord ſpeaks of the <hi>Vine-branch,</hi> which <hi>had been in him the true Vine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John <hi>15.</hi> v. <hi>6.</hi>

And if they be <hi>unfruitful,</hi> they are <hi>unprofitable</hi> and good for nothing; the Fig-tree <hi>cumbers the ground,</hi> and <hi>makes it idle,</hi> and unprofitable, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.7. ſo the Greek word ſignifies,<note place="margin">Luke <hi>13.</hi> v. <hi>7.</hi>

               <p>By what hath bin ſaid <hi>touching</hi> the <hi>genus</hi> or <hi>common nature</hi> of <hi>Ezob,</hi> it appears to be a <hi>tree;</hi> and therefore not <hi>Hyſſop,</hi> which is an <hi>herb,</hi> as was ſhewen before. And therefore its more probably to be underſtood of <hi>Libanotis</hi> or <hi>Roſmary.</hi> As for the <hi>ſubject place Ezob</hi> is ſaid to grow <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in, <hi>by</hi> or <hi>againſt the wall;</hi> not <hi>out</hi> of it (as ours turn the word) as indeed <hi>Hyſſop</hi> ſometime doth; but the <hi>Ezob</hi> or Roſmary tree growes and thrives beſt <hi>by,</hi> or <hi>againſt the wall,</hi> as common experience proves; whereas <hi>Hyſſop</hi> proſpers beſt other where in our Gardens.</p>
               <p>So that the deſcription of <hi>Ezob,</hi> both according to the <hi>common nature</hi> of it, and the particular place of <hi>growth,</hi> agrees to <hi>Roſmary,</hi> not to <hi>Hyſſop.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The uſe of <hi>Ezob,</hi> in holy Scripture, was to <hi>ſprinkle</hi> the blood of the Sacrifice, and the <hi>Sin-water,</hi> or <hi>water of ſeparation.</hi> For of it, together with <hi>Cedar-word</hi> and <hi>Scarlet-wool,</hi> was made the <hi>Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillum</hi> or <hi>aſperſorium;</hi> which we may render the <hi>Sin-water-ſtock;</hi> ſo that a ſmall handful of <hi>Ezob</hi> conſiſting of three ſtalks four Inches long, was tied to a Cedar-handle of a foot and half long; and that was the <hi>aſpergillum.</hi> Hence its eaſie to judge, whether <hi>Hyſſop</hi> or <hi>Roſmary</hi> were the more fit and proper for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

               <p>Doubtleſs there is not the ſame reaſon of all men.

And every man hath his proper gift, ſaith the Apoſtle. However therefore the Lord hath propounded a <hi>common ſalvation</hi> unto all the ſons of men, <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 3. whereof all men are capable, and hath preſcribed <hi>common means</hi> which <hi>all men</hi> muſt make uſe of, if they will be ſaved, as <hi>repentance, faith,</hi> and <hi>obedience of faith;</hi> yet ſeveral and particular means may be made uſe of alſo, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the great variety of diſpoſitions and inclinations of men; as alſo according to the divers ranks and orders of men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as therefore ſome men are of a more <hi>free and lightſome ſpirit,</hi> they are rather inclined to an <hi>active life,</hi> to live in <hi>vita communi,</hi> and <hi>in luce,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaks, to live ſociably among men. Others of a more <hi>ſad</hi> and melancholick ſpirit, are inclined rather to <hi>retyred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>contemplation.</hi> And ſuch as theſe, were ſome of the ancient Monks and Eremites, as <hi>Antonius,</hi> and others; who ſequeſtring themſelves from the world and wordly imployments, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated themſelvs unto God, dwelling <hi>alone</hi> remote from others, leading a <hi>ſolitary life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereby I approve not the late ſuperſtitious and <hi>forced Monchery,</hi> but a pious <hi>ſolitude</hi> and holy <hi>retyredneſs</hi> (if it be poſſible) from the tumults and troubles of this preſent evil world; which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not only not unlawful, but expedient, yea, neceſſary for ſome men. And therefore moſt what religious men having ſpent much of their life paſt in wordly imployments, deſire, in their declining years, to retire themſelves unto greater <hi>privacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howbeit a change of <hi>place</hi> is not ſo neceſſary as a change of <hi>minde.</hi> He who fulfils not the luſts of his fleſh, who mindes not earthly things; who, though he live among <hi>men,</hi> among <hi>riches,</hi> among <hi>honours,</hi> yet is as a <hi>ſtranger</hi> to them, and eſteems them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are, and uſes them as if he uſed them not; ſuch an one

               <p>More eſpecially, this may be obſerved in regard of diverſe <hi>ranks</hi> and <hi>orders</hi> of men. For ſuch choſen veſſels as the Lord would make <hi>Radices communitatis,</hi> publick perſons, and ſuch as ſhould inſtruct others, unto theſe he ſpeaks a part; theſe he <hi>takes a ſide from the multitude,</hi> and puts his fingers in their <hi>ears;</hi> teacheth them firſt obedience; then toucheth their <hi>tongue,</hi> and enables them to teach others; according to Chriſts method of curing the <hi>deaf man who could hardly ſpeak, Mark</hi> 7.32, 33.

               <p>Were we exhorted unto an outward <hi>ſolitude,</hi> men of all ranks would go out into the <hi>wilderneſs</hi> as they did to hear <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt: But when we are called to an <hi>introverſion,</hi> into our <hi>wildred heart,</hi> to hear the <hi>voice of God crying</hi> there, (that's <hi>John,</hi>) how few, alas how few deſire ſo to retyre themſelves?

               <p>All endeavours are in vain or to little purpoſe before ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrement: And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> perſwades <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let the people go into the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> that they might <hi>ſerve</hi> the Lord. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was content that they ſhould offer ſacrifice in the land of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 8.25.

Thou art the God of my <hi>ſtrength;</hi> O ſend out thy <hi>light.</hi> And 84.11. The Lord is a <hi>Sun</hi> and a <hi>Shield.</hi> And 132.17. The <hi>horn or ſtrength</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and the <hi>Lamp or light</hi> of his Anointed; which <hi>Zachary</hi> underſtood of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.69. Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Chriſt the <hi>power</hi> of God, and the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. Both which are ſometimes woven into one Phraſe, as when Chriſt is called the <hi>Sun,</hi> and compared to a <hi>Gyant or ſtrong man</hi> to run his courſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. And he appears to S. <hi>John,</hi> as the <hi>Sun ſhining in his ſtrength, Revel.</hi> 1.16. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> coucheth both as cloſely, when, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12. he exhorts us to put on the <hi>Armour of light;</hi> which in the next words he varies; Put on, ſaith he, the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> v. 14. as the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have conſidered the two former Axioms; 1. A part: 2. Compared one with other. In the ſame method let us proceed in handling the two following. Whereof the former is; That <hi>Scepter</hi> ſhall <hi>ſmite</hi> the <hi>Corners</hi> of <hi>Moab.</hi> Wherein we have this <hi>Kings</hi> adminiſtration and government of his kingdom, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing the enemies of it, in particular, the <hi>Moabites.</hi> Wherein we muſt inquire; 1. What are the <hi>corners</hi> of <hi>Moab.</hi> 2. What it is to <hi>ſmite</hi> the <hi>corners of Moab.</hi> 1. What are the <hi>corners</hi> of <hi>Moab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moab</hi> is here compared unto a <hi>building;</hi> whereof the great ſtrength lies in the <hi>corners,</hi> as in Gods <hi>building</hi> which is his Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. Chriſt is the chief <hi>corner</hi> ſtone, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. And accordingly the moſt of our Engliſh tranſlations have <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> or <hi>coaſts:</hi> but the Meſſiahs wars are not with <hi>buildings,</hi> but with <hi>men.</hi> And therefore by the ſame metaphore, the Princes of <hi>Moab</hi> are called the <hi>corners</hi> of it. So the Chald. Par. hath <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>What reaſon is there why the Lord, 1. <hi>Smites</hi> the <hi>Princes of Moab;</hi> 2. Why he <hi>ſmites them thorow.</hi>
               </p>

Tis true, they were ſo; but different degrees of the ſame people. In the name of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is underſtood a <hi>perfect man,</hi> one who prevails with God. And therefore, by how much the more ſtrong and powerful he is, by ſo much the more vehement &amp; impetuous oppoſition he may expect. While a man is only as <hi>Jacob,</hi> imployed only in inferiour actions, and as yet <hi>weak</hi> (for ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> is a figure of the Church in its <hi>weakneſs,</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in its <hi>ſtrength</hi>) while we are as <hi>Jacob,</hi> as yet <hi>weak,</hi> its to be expected that we ſuffer <hi>oppoſition</hi> and <hi>curſing:</hi> but when we grow up in <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and become <hi>ſtrong</hi> as <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we muſt then expect <hi>Super maledictions, curſings</hi> upon <hi>curſings.

               <p>O ye <hi>ſons of Sheth,</hi> Let us be ſubject, let us ſubmit our ſelves unto the <hi>Scepter</hi> of Chriſt.

For neither the Pſalmiſt, nor the Apoſtle ſetting forth the glory of Chriſts <hi>Scepter,</hi> commends it to us from the <hi>amplitude</hi> and <hi>largeneſs</hi> of his dominion, but from the <hi>rectitude</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> of it.

               <p>How equal, how juſt, how reaſonable a duty is it, that we <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> our ſelves unto this <hi>Scepter of Chriſt?</hi> yet who owns his <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</hi> who ſlights not his <hi>authority?</hi> What elſe do we more or leſs all of us, when we <hi>neglect</hi> his known <hi>commands,</hi> the <hi>Edicts</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> of the greateſt King?

                  <hi>ye ſhall do no ſervile work</hi> therein.] The only wiſe and good God, who loves the man better then the man loves himſelf, according to that, <hi>Charior eſt ſuperis homo quàm ſibi,</hi> Man is more dear unto God, then he is to himſelf; out of that intire love unto man, he not only ſignifies in expreſs words, what his will is, but intimates the ſame alſo more implicitly, in ceremonies, as Sacrifices, and Sacraments, and Sacramental ſignes, meats and drinks, as alſo certain times, as dayes, and weeks, and moneths, and years, Feſtival dayes, new Moons, and Sabbaths; which are a ſhadow, ſaith <hi>S. Paul,</hi> of things to come, but the body is of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. Hence it was, that the holy Apoſtles, when they preached the Goſpel, they delivered the will of God ſhadowed in the law. The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus taught them ſo to do, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.21. beginning at <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himſelf.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>But our Tranſlators here call the laſt day of every ſuch Feaſt, a <hi>ſolemn aſſembly,</hi> as here the <hi>eighth day</hi> of the <hi>feaſt of Tabernacles:</hi> whereas <gap reason="foreign">

To like purpoſe <hi>Munſter;</hi> who turns the word <hi>Retentio;</hi> and gives reaſon, becauſe the ſeven dayes of the ſolemnity being paſt, the people was yet <hi>retained</hi> one day. So <hi>Luther</hi> explains it. <hi>Piſcator</hi> in his High Dutch Tranſlation turns the word, <hi>Verbotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tag,</hi> which in his Latin he renders, <hi>Dies interdicti,</hi> a <hi>day of prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition;</hi> and his reaſon is, with reference to the following words; becauſe on it, all <hi>ſervile work was forbidden. Tyndal</hi> and another after him, renders it a <hi>Collection;</hi> not becauſe money was then <hi>gathered</hi> for the reparation of the Tabernacle, or to buy Sacrifices, as <hi>Lyra</hi> and ſome others have conceived; but becauſe the people were then <hi>gathered</hi> and <hi>retained together.</hi> And ſo the Chald. Paraph. expreſly renders the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> by <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe this <hi>Collection</hi> and <hi>retention</hi> was on the laſt day of the Feaſt, as <hi>S. John</hi> calls it, <hi>John</hi> 7. Therefore one of our old Engliſh Tranſlators turns the word, <hi>The concluſion of the Feaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>Collection, Retention,</hi> or <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the Feaſt, was on the <hi>eighth day.</hi> Which day was ſupernumerary and above the number of the Feaſt, which conſiſted of <hi>Seven dayes;</hi> as appears <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.34.

               <p>The reaſon of this <hi>Collection</hi> and <hi>retention</hi> of the people on the <hi>eighth day,</hi> is to be referred unto the authority of divine inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the end of it, is well worthy his divine wiſdom and goodneſs who ordained it. For the ſame <hi>Feaſt of Tabernacles</hi> was inſtituted in the ſeventh moneth, the moneth <hi>Tizri,</hi> which in part anſwers to our September; when they had now gathered in the increaſe of the year, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.24. Then ye ſhall dwell in <hi>Booths,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>ſeven dayes:</hi> every home-born in Iſrael ſhall dwell in <hi>Booths,</hi> that your generations may know, that I made the ſons of Iſrael to dwell in <hi>Booths,</hi> when I brought them out from the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> I am the Lord your God, ver. 42, 43. That the people might remember and conſider, their ſlavery in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their deliverance out of it. Their <hi>penury</hi> and <hi>poverty</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> when they were <hi>houſeleſs,</hi> and <hi>harborleſs;</hi> and their
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:65717:298"/>
                  <hi>plenty</hi> and <hi>abundance</hi> in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when they dwelt in <hi>houſes</hi> that they had not built. And therefore the Law was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be read every ſeventh year at that feaſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.10. that they might hear, and learn, and fear the Lord their God (the author of all this good unto them) and obſerve to do all the words of his Law. And for that end, after the ordaining of that <hi>Feaſt, Levit.</hi> 23.43. is added, <hi>I am the Lord your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is that the LXX render <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which ſome have conceived to be ſo turned, becauſe that <hi>Song</hi> was ſo called, which the old Greek Stage-players <hi>ſung</hi> at the end of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, when they went off the Stage; as <hi>Suidas,</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> and others affirm. Accordingly ſome conceive, that the Greek In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters alluded to this cuſtom of the Stage-players, becauſe, when they ended the <hi>Feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> they returned to their houſes with great joy.</p>
               <p>But truly I am not eaſily perſwaded, that the Greek Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would ſo much honour the <hi>Comedians,</hi> and their profane Stage-cuſtomes, as to transfer them unto the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but the LXX gave this name to the <hi>Feaſt,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the divine inſtitution of it, as hath been ſhewen, in memory of <hi>Iſraels</hi> coming forth of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the ſame reaſon, they gave the name <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a <hi>diſmiſsion to the people:</hi> that is, the people <hi>may depart.</hi> And the like cuſtom was in the Latin Church.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>antient,</hi> and now <hi>antiquated</hi> cuſtomes of the <hi>Church,</hi> eaſily diſcover unto us, what <hi>Diſſolutae ſcopae,</hi> what <hi>looſe</hi> and <hi>confuſed</hi> companies our Church-congregations moſt-what are; as being neither duely <hi>gathered</hi> and <hi>aſſembled together;</hi> nor <hi>detained</hi> by any gentle and moderate <hi>reſtraint</hi> upon them; nor <hi>decently diſmiſſed.</hi> All which might well become the people of the <hi>God of order,</hi> and the comely <hi>body of Chriſt the head.</hi> But at this day, moſt men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a great part of their Chriſtian <hi>liberty,</hi> to be <hi>diſorderly, and to do what they liſt.</hi> So that our Church-Aſſemblies are like peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſome going, others coming from the Market: or like Bees, alwayes ſome going in, others out of the Hive. But if we begin to ſpeak of theſe diſorders, we ſhall never come to an end.</p>
               <p>Come we rather to the ſpiritual meaning of theſe words.

               <p>All they who keep this feaſt, are the home-born of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who

               </p>
               <p>The ſecond rule of the feaſt, is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Ye ſhall do no ſervile work therein;</hi> word for word, ye ſhall do no work of <hi>ſervitude. [Therein]</hi> is a ſupplement, how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, I ſhall ſhew anone.</p>
               <p>Herein we muſt inquire, 1. what this <hi>ſervile</hi> work or work of <hi>ſervitude</hi> is. And it is hard to ſay, ſince diſputes of the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> and <hi>Summiſts</hi> about it, have made it intricate. They conclude and agree moſt-what, that by a <hi>ſervile work</hi> is to be underſtood ſome <hi>corporal, mechanical</hi> or artificial work; how be it they hence except works of <hi>necesſity</hi> to be done, and ſuch as whereby men may <hi>ſerve one another in love.</hi> Alſo by a <hi>ſervile work,</hi> they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand journeying, dancing, ſinging, fidling, hunting, fiſhing, fowling, painting, marketing, going to law, doing any work for a reward; whence in the Arabic verſion a ſervile work, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>work of gain</hi> or for gain.</p>
               <p>Light of nature taught the heathen, that on their <hi>holy days</hi> and <hi>feaſt days,</hi> they muſt do no work. So <hi>Tully</hi> in his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. book <hi>de le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus.</hi> And <hi>Macrobius</hi> in his firſt book ſaith, the Prieſts affirm, that their <hi>Festivals</hi> are polluted, if any <hi>work</hi> be done in them. Only they ſay, <hi>Feriis agi licere, quod praetermiſſum noceret,</hi> that ſuch <hi>work</hi> may be done on their <hi>Holy dayes,</hi> which might <hi>do hurt</hi> if left undone; as to draw an Ox out of a pit. Whereby it appears, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> knew not only the law of nature, but ſomewhat of the Goſpel alſo. For this ſentence of <hi>Scaevola</hi> the <hi>high Prieſt</hi> hath good conformity with what the only <hi>true high Prieſt</hi> delivers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like occaſion, touching the <hi>Sabbath, Luke</hi> 13.15, 16.</p>
               <p>According to this account, we may finde ſomewhat like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity even among the idolatrous Heathen; yea, the Heathen, if we conſider, and compare them according to their light, with many who believe themſelves to be the only Chriſtians, they may ſhame them and all other, who place the <hi>breach of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in ſitting at their doors,</hi> or <hi>walking a turn in the field.</hi> Which haply may be as neceſſary for ſome <hi>man,</hi> as <hi>plucking a Sheep out of a pit on the Sabbath day:</hi> And how much is a man better then a Sheep? ſaith our Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.12.

               <p>We muſt therefore inquire yet further what a <hi>ſervile work</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Others have conceived, that by a <hi>ſervile work,</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſuch <hi>work</hi> as a <hi>Servant</hi> or <hi>Handmaid</hi> is wont to do; and thus the LXX call it <gap reason="foreign">

We are therefore yet to ſeek what is that <hi>ſervile work,</hi> which is here forbidden to be <hi>done</hi> on the <hi>eighth day.</hi> There is no queſtion but Iſrael, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> underſtood by a <hi>work or works of ſervitude,</hi> ſuch as they <hi>wrought</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> when the Egyptians made them <hi>ſerve</hi> with rigour,<note place="margin">Exod. <hi>1.</hi> v. <hi>14.</hi>

               <p>It reſts therefore, that, ſince, according to our Lords deciſion, it is lawful to do well on the Sabbathday, well-doing is not forbidden on the <hi>eighth day;</hi> ſo that the <hi>ſirvile work</hi> is the <hi>ſinful work;</hi> &amp; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever commits ſin, is the ſervant of ſin, <hi>John</hi> 8.34. Hence it is, that the ſinful man yields his members <hi>ſervants</hi> to <hi>iniquity</hi> unto <hi>iniquity,</hi> (that is, from one degree of iniquity unto another,) and ſo he becomes the <hi>ſervant of ſin, Rom.</hi> 6.19.20.

               <p>The reaſon why no ſuch <hi>ſervile work</hi> is to be <hi>done</hi> on the <hi>eighth day,</hi> may appear from 1. Divine authority forbidding it; the Lord ſaith, ye ſhall do no <hi>ſervile work.</hi> 2. In regard of the <hi>work</hi> it ſelf, which is <gap reason="foreign">

And this number being the firſt perfect number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to the perfect Architect and Workman, as alſo to his work, to whom &amp; to which, nothing is wanting, nothing is ſuperfluous. And therefore when the Creator had finiſhed his work of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and produced and parted it into this number of ſix, <hi>Moſes</hi> adds his <hi>Epiphonema; Perfecti ſunt igitur coeli &amp; terra &amp; omnis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitus eorum, Gen.</hi> 2.1. Thus the Heavens and the Earth were <hi>fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,</hi> and all the hoſt of them.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Orpheus</hi> who had read theſe works of God in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> (as <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> and many others of the learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had done) he put a Period and a full cloſe to his Hymns and Songs, in the ſixth generation; becauſe the argument of his Hymns were, in this ſixth generation, wholly <hi>concluded and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;</hi> becauſe in that number of dayes, the <hi>great workman,</hi> God himſelf had <hi>finiſhed</hi> his <hi>work in ſix dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if more curiouſly we conſider the egreſs and progreſs of the Workmaſter, the number of ſix, wherein this Fabrick was made, is fitly repreſented by a <hi>Triangle,</hi> whoſe baſe is <hi>three,</hi> the top <hi>one,</hi> and the middle <hi>two.</hi> For the whole Fabrick or work of the World, is raiſed, &amp; proceeds from the <hi>three ſubſiſtences</hi> which
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:65717:306"/>are called <hi>perſons,</hi> whoſe works <hi>Ad extra</hi> are undevided; and they tend unto <hi>one</hi> end, the glory of the <hi>one</hi> and <hi>onely God.</hi> The <hi>Tranſitus</hi> or paſſage is by a <hi>Binarius,</hi> a <hi>Duality,</hi> by two, which is the <hi>matter;</hi> and is <hi>conſummate and perfected by union, which is the form.</hi> Thus the divine Philoſopher in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> Where God, ſaith he, the Maker of the World, hath produced the number of Heaven and Earth, he preſently made the <hi>light,</hi> whereby the Creators might be diſtinguiſhed and diſtinctly known; the <hi>Chaos</hi> was the <hi>matter,</hi> the <hi>light</hi> the <hi>form;</hi> the firſt <hi>dayes work.</hi> On the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day,</hi> he ſet the <hi>Firmament</hi> between the waters above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, even the <hi>Divine Wiſdom</hi> and the <hi>Humane,</hi> leſt there ſhould be a greater influence then this inferiour World could receive.

               <p>The reaſon of this conſequence, is; man was made in the image and ſimilitude of his God.

               <p>But indeed why ſhould <hi>Moſes</hi> be ſo extreme curious in deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the <hi>place</hi> where he ſpake theſe words to all Iſrael? It is true, the <hi>Argument</hi> he treats of, is of great moment; but ſo likewiſe are many other, which are not ſo <hi>circumſtantiated</hi> with names of <hi>places;</hi> as the firſt giving the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. The Apoſtaſie of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.14. In both Scriptures the <hi>actions</hi> are named and ſpecified each by one <hi>place,</hi> and no more. And there are many like.</p>
               <p>Nor were ſome of theſe <hi>places</hi> named, ſo nigh the paſſage over <hi>Jordan,</hi> where theſe words were ſpoken, as to <hi>ſpecifie</hi> it; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by moſt of them, if we compare them with the Chorogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Tables. Yea, ſome words underſtood of <hi>places,</hi> will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove ſo, as will be manifeſt unto thoſe who ſhall well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them.</p>
               <p>The Chaldee Paraphraſt opens the whole buſineſs, declaring ſummarily in theſe few words, the <hi>Argument</hi> of the whole Book of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> and the practiſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> herein conformable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other Governours of Gods Church. For thus he underſtood and explained this verſe, as minding and reproving Iſrael for their ſins committed in the <hi>places</hi> mentioned. Thus by, <hi>[Theſe words]</hi> he underſtands <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>reprehenſory words: Moſes</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, ſaith he, becauſe they ſinned in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they tempted God in the <hi>Plains</hi> over againſt the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and in <hi>Pharan.</hi> Where they murmured againſt <hi>Manna.</hi> And in <hi>Hazeroth,</hi> where they provoked God for fleſh.

               <p>Which opinion of the Chald. Par. is ſo probable, that Rabbi <hi>Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> and others follow it. Yea, <hi>Rupertus</hi> was ſo far perſwaded of this, that hereby he explains the Lords words, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.22. <hi>[They have tempted me theſe ten times,]</hi> to be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, and not taken for <hi>many,</hi> as elſewhere, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Job.</hi> 19.3.

               <p>Laſtly, according to this interpretation, the Chald. Paraph. brings in <hi>Moſes</hi> now toward his death, <hi>reproving</hi> the ſons of Iſrael; as <hi>Moſes</hi> had brought in Iſrael himſelf doing the like, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before his end, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.1, 2, 3.—33. In like manner <hi>Samuel</hi> in his old age ſharply rebuked the people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. And that great example of all Governours, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Lord raiſed up like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> He, before his aſſcenſion into heaven, left a ſevere <hi>reproof</hi> with his commiſſion to the Apoſtles, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.14.</p>
               <p>But let us proceed unto the following words.</p>
               <p>(There were <hi>eleven dayes</hi> journey <hi>from Horeb</hi> by <hi>the way of Mount Seir,</hi>

               <p>It is <hi>S. Auguſtins</hi> obſervation, lib. 15. de Civit. Dei, cap. 20.

               <p>So the Lord will be with us, as he was with thoſe <hi>Travailers, Luke</hi> 24.13. who went to <hi>Emaüs, Timoris conſilium,</hi> the <hi>counſel of fear,</hi> (as that word is interpreted) for <hi>timor</hi> is <hi>conſiliativus, fear</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines us to take <hi>counſel,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aquinas.</hi> And that name imports the firſt ſtate of the new converts under <hi>fear;</hi> which is ſaid to be upon every ſoul, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.43. which is figured, when the Diſciples are ſaid to be unanimous altogether in <hi>Solomons Porch,</hi> a type of <hi>Gods fear</hi> in the ſpiritual Tabernacle.

               <p>The words contain the Lords free <hi>donation</hi> of <hi>Sihon</hi> and his land, into the power of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The gift is either perſonal or real. 1. <hi>Perſonal,</hi> and ſo we have the <hi>name</hi> of the perſon, <hi>Sihon,</hi> illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:65717:321"/>by his <hi>nation,</hi> an <hi>Amorite,</hi> his royal authority, <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>royal City, Heſhbon.</hi> 2. The <hi>real gift</hi> is his <hi>land.</hi> Of theſe, the Lord gives Iſrael a demonſtration: Behold, or ſee, I have given into thy hand, <hi>Sihon, &amp;c.</hi> In which words theſe Axioms are contained. 1. <hi>Sihon</hi> the <hi>Amorite</hi> King of <hi>Heſhbon</hi> had his land. 2. God gave into the hand of <hi>Iſrael, Sihon</hi> the <hi>Amorite</hi> King of <hi>Heſhbon,</hi> and his land. 3. The Lord ſaith, Behold I have given in thy hand, <hi>Sihon</hi> the <hi>Amorite</hi> King, &amp;c. 1. <hi>Sihon</hi> the <hi>Amorite</hi> King of <hi>Heſhbon</hi> had his land. The land of <hi>Sihon</hi> is that which is otherwiſe called the land of <hi>Gilead,</hi> as appears, <hi>Numb.</hi> 32. <hi>v.</hi> 29. compar'd with <hi>v.</hi> 33. Howbeit this land of <hi>Gilead</hi> was now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the land of the <hi>Amorites;</hi> for <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> had fought againſt the former King of <hi>Moab,</hi> and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto <hi>Arnon, Numb.</hi> 21.26. And this was <hi>Sihons land.</hi> What was his <hi>City?</hi> His <hi>City</hi> was called <hi>Heſhbon;</hi> that was the royal City of <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites, Numb.</hi> 21.25. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>Whence obſerve, that 1. <hi>Sihon</hi> the <hi>Amorite,</hi> a wicked man, had his land; the Lord calls it his: So the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> all ſinful nations yet had their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Territories by the <hi>beſt right, Jure divino,</hi> by <hi>divine right,</hi> as appears by <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.5.9.19. Whence it is evident, That <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num rerum temporalium non fundatur in gratia. The dominion of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things is not founded in grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the myſtical meaning of theſe words. <hi>Sihon</hi> has his name from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is of the ſame ſignification and extent with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is to <hi>ſweep away duſt, durt or filth;</hi> alſo to <hi>deſtroy, extirpate, and root up.</hi> So that <hi>Sihon</hi> is a <hi>Sweeper,</hi> a <hi>Deſtroyer,</hi> one who <hi>extirpates</hi> and <hi>roots up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are no meet qualifications for a King: yet this <hi>Sihon</hi> is ſaid to be King of <hi>Heſhbon.</hi> That's <hi>Sihons royal City;</hi> and what is <hi>Heſhbou?</hi> What elſe but the thought and imagination? So <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies. So that <hi>Sihon</hi> the <hi>Amorite</hi> is that <hi>talking, bitter, froward, rebellious, domineering ſpirit</hi> in men; which <hi>ſweeps away, deſtroyes, extirpates,</hi> and <hi>roots out all good cogitations and thoughts out of us,</hi> and implants <hi>all evil thoughts</hi> in their room. And in theſe <hi>evil thoughts Sihon</hi> dwels.—<hi>Ill â ſe jactat in aula. Sihon</hi> keeps his Court in <hi>Heſhbon</hi> among the <hi>thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That we may the better underſtand what <hi>Sihons royal City</hi> and <hi>Court</hi> is, we muſt know, what <hi>Heſhbon</hi> the <hi>thought</hi> and <hi>thoughts</hi> are. They are certain inward acts of the reaſonable ſoul; which may be conſidered either <hi>abſtractly</hi> in themſelves, as they are without commerce or influence upon the affections, &amp; receive no taint from them; and ſo they may be ſaid to be <hi>indifferent.</hi> Such are they, which befal men waking like Dreams. Theſe, although we cannot call them <hi>evil;</hi> becauſe they receive no corruption
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:65717:321"/>from the <hi>evil will and affections;</hi> yet without doubt they are great impediments and rubs in <hi>our ſpiritual journey;</hi> and hinder our proficiency and growth in grace; yea, and too evident a ſigne they are of an empty heart, that is not filled with the love of God. For if the heart be filled with theſe, <hi>intus exiſtens prohibet extraneum,</hi> they keep off God from his Sanctuary, <hi>Eezch.</hi> 8.6.</p>
               <p>The <hi>thoughts</hi> may be conſidered <hi>concretely,</hi> as they excite and ſtir up affections, 1. Either to <hi>good,</hi> as concerning our God, and the eternal ſtate of our ſouls; and ſo conſequently the <hi>thoughts are good;</hi> as where the Pſalmiſt ſaith, I ſaid or <hi>thought,</hi> I will look to my wayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. Or 2. As they move us to <hi>evil;</hi> in which regard, they may be called <hi>evil thoughts, Ezech.</hi> 38.10.</p>
               <p>So that the <hi>good or evil thoughts</hi> receive their <hi>tincture</hi> and <hi>name</hi> from their objects whereabout they are converſant and buſied. But becauſe as <hi>Scire malum non eſt malum,</hi> to <hi>know evil,</hi> is <hi>not evil;</hi> ſo <hi>Scire bonum non eſt bonum,</hi> to know what <hi>is good,</hi> is not <hi>that good we know,</hi> we muſt underſtand that <hi>thoughts</hi> are either <hi>ſpeculative</hi> or <hi>practical;</hi> 1. The <hi>ſpeculative thoughts</hi> buſied about <hi>evil,</hi> it is not neceſſary, that the <hi>thoughts</hi> themſelves ſhould be <hi>evil.</hi> For God himſelf is ſaid to <hi>know the vain and ſinful thoughts of men, Pſal.</hi> 94.11. when yet his <hi>thoughts</hi> are no more infected by the <hi>evil,</hi> then the Sun is by ſhining on a Dunghil. And thus ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men have <hi>known evil,</hi> and how to act it, yet have not done it; as its ſaid of <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperour, that he <hi>knew</hi> how to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the hands of all the great men of <hi>Rome,</hi> but he never did it unto any mans hurt. How much more is this true of our Lord and his Apoſtles? who, in their reproofs and dehortations, are neceſſarily ſuppoſed to have <hi>known the evils,</hi> which they <hi>reproved,</hi> and from which, they <hi>deborted;</hi> yet were they not ſo much as in a <hi>thought</hi> guilty of them, or corrupted by them. Howbeit in men under an inferior diſpenſation, even <hi>ſpeculative thoughts of evil,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job <hi>31.</hi> v. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> may adminiſter oecaſion of <hi>evil.</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> reaſons, I have <hi>ſtricken</hi> a covenant with mine eyes, <hi>and</hi> why ſhould I <hi>think</hi> upon a Maid?</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>practical thoughts</hi> about <hi>evil,</hi> which proceed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and conſent in the <hi>evil,</hi> there is no doubt but they are <hi>evil.</hi> And in theſe, <hi>Sihon,</hi> having rooted out the old inhabitants out of the heart, the <hi>good thoughts</hi> proceeding from God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. he brings in a Colonie of his <hi>evil thoughts;</hi> and theſe are his <hi>royal City,</hi> his <hi>Manſion houſe</hi> where he reſides and dwels.</p>
               <p>Hence we may obſerve, that if <hi>Sihon</hi> be King of <hi>Heſhbon,</hi> if the <hi>deſtructive</hi> and <hi>extirpating ſpirit</hi> bear rule in our <hi>thoughts,</hi> the man is no doubt <hi>fallen</hi> from his God. For ſince the <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>fons omninum actionum ad extra,</hi>—ſince all actions proceed from the <hi>heart,</hi> and moſt mens <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> are moſt <hi>unlike</hi> unto God, unto whoſe <hi>image</hi> the man was made, it cannot be but the <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>Fountain of our thoughts and actions,</hi> hath been corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

But I ſee no ſuch matter, ſaith weak <hi>Jacob.</hi> Not with thy <hi>bodily eyes;</hi> this object is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto thine <hi>eye of faith.</hi> Nor can theſe things be made known unto us but by the Spirit of God. We have received, not the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>this world,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit that is of God,</hi> that we may <hi>know</hi> the things that are <hi>freely given</hi> to us of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. And therfore when the Prophet <hi>Eliſha's</hi> ſervant feared the army of the <hi>Syrians</hi> which compaſſed the City of <hi>Dothan</hi> round about; Fear not, ſaith <hi>Eliſha,</hi> for there are more with us then they who are with them; and withal he prayes, Lord open his eyes.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> and his ſervant were beſieged with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Syrians, Pride and deceit and the curſe due to theſe;</hi> theſe are <hi>Aramites</hi> or <hi>Syrians;</hi> and theſe compaſs <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that is, <hi>God the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> and his ſervants; yea, Sin is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Begiu, poſſeſs, contend with him in battel.</hi> Hitherto we have heard the three <hi>prepuratory Exhortations;</hi> and their perſwaſives and motives inducing to the <hi>war.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to thoſe <hi>Exhortations</hi> which we may call <hi>execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</hi> And they alſo are three. <hi>Begin, poſſeſs, contend with him in battel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Begin.</hi> This word ſometimes imports no more then the <hi>act</hi> it ſelf which one is ſaid to <hi>begin;</hi> as its ſaid of our Lord, He <hi>began</hi> to ſay, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.1. that is, He <hi>ſaid, Matth.</hi> 16.6. He <hi>began</hi> to caſt out, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.15. that is, <hi>He did caſt out, Matth.</hi> 21.12. Sometime it ſignifies the entrance and <hi>firſt part</hi> of the work; as, he that hath <hi>begun</hi> a good work, will finiſh it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. And thus it may be a general exhortation enlarging it ſelf to all the reſt, as the <hi>entrance and firſt part</hi> of them; <hi>Begin</hi> to <hi>ariſe, begin to take your journey; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to paſs over Arnon,</hi> to <hi>poſſeſs,</hi> to <hi>contend with him in battel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence it appears, that, after all the precedent exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to <hi>ariſe</hi> from <hi>ſin to righteouſneſs,</hi> from <hi>death to life,</hi> men are prone to lie ſtill in ſin and iniquity. After exhortation <hi>to take their journey</hi> toward the ſpiritual land, men are rather <hi>inclined to ſtay at home in the fleſh.</hi> After exhortation to <hi>paſs over the River Arnon,</hi> they had rather <hi>be ſtill children</hi> in <hi>Kadeſhbarnea.</hi> After the Lords <hi>free donation</hi> of <hi>Sihon</hi> the <hi>Amorite</hi> King of <hi>Heſhbon</hi> and his land, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>our power,</hi> and his <hi>evidencing this to our faith,</hi> men <hi>hardly believe</hi> any ſuch thing poſſible. And therefore the Lord yet ſtirs us up, <hi>Begin, ariſe, begin, take your journey, begin, paſs over the river Arnon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence its alſo evident, that the work of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> is not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly finiſhed, or in a ſhort time, ſince ſo many exhortations are needful thereunto, and the work as yet not done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. According to the meaſure of <hi>grace</hi> vouchſafed unto us, there ought to be a ſuitable complying and endeavour to walk worthy of that <hi>grace.</hi> The Lord ſaith, he hath <hi>given Sihon</hi> and his land unto <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and v. 31. See, I have <hi>begun</hi> to give <hi>Sihon</hi> and his land before thy face: therefore <hi>ariſe, take your journey;</hi> therefore <hi>begin</hi> thou to poſſeſs it.</p>
               <p>Behold, here a figure of the <hi>mutable</hi> and <hi>inconſiſtent eſtate;</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is repreſented unto us in the ſpiritual <hi>childehood.</hi> The people lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred and continued in their <hi>unſetled condition,</hi> without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, or going on. Whence it is, that <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us, that theſe things befel the people in <hi>Kadeſhbarnea, Deut.</hi> 1. That is, <hi>Sanctitas filii inſtabilis,</hi> the <hi>unſtable holineſs of the ſon or childe;</hi> or rather, the <hi>ſanctity</hi> and <hi>holineſs</hi> of <hi>moveable, changeable,</hi> and <hi>unſetled purity,</hi> ſuch as is that of the childe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. as I have formerly ſhewen.</p>
               <pb n="618" facs="tcp:65717:324"/>
               <p>And if we look upon the preſent ſtate of Chriſtianity, we ſhall finde moſt-what ſuch a kinde of <hi>inſtability</hi> and <hi>unſetledneſs,</hi> among men. The ſecond book of <hi>Eſdras</hi> is a Prophetical hiſtory of times then to come. Among other predictions we finde this, 2 <hi>Eſder.</hi> 15.14, 15, 16.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2</hi> Eſdr. <hi>15</hi> v. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Wo to the world and them that dwell therein:</hi> For the Sword and their deſtruction draweth nigh: And one people ſhall ſtand up to fight againſt another, and ſwords in their hands. And there ſhall be <hi>ſedition</hi> among men, and invading one another. They ſhall not regard their Kings, nor Princes; and the courſe of their actions ſhall ſtand in their power.</p>
               <p>What our Tranſlators turn, <hi>Sedition,</hi> is <hi>Inconſtabilitio,</hi> which is rather to be rendred unſettlement, or inſtability. How true that propheſie is, may appear to any who ſhall impartially take a ſurvey of the Chriſtian Church now for many years, eſpecially in this our nation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence they are juſtly reproved who <hi>lie ſtill</hi> in their <hi>fall; ſet not forth,</hi> nor <hi>begin their journey;</hi> but abide on the other ſide <hi>Arnon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet (O wicked imagination! how haſt thou covered the whole face of the earth?) even theſe men think, they are come to their <hi>journeys end. Sihon</hi> the <hi>Amorite</hi> King of <hi>Heſhbon,</hi> who <hi>roots out the good thoughts,</hi> and <hi>implants evil</hi> in their room, he bewitches them, and perſwades them, that they have built goodly <hi>caſtles of aſſurance</hi> in the air, when they have not yet laid the <hi>foundation,</hi> they have not yet <hi>begun</hi> the work; that they have <hi>climbed up</hi> to the top of <hi>Jacobs Ladder,</hi> when indeed they have not yet ſet their foot on the <hi>firſt round.</hi> They are <hi>fully aſſured</hi> and certain of their ſalvation, before they have <hi>denyed themſelves, taken up their croſs,</hi> and <hi>followed their Saviour.</hi> Theſe indeed have <hi>begun their journey,</hi> but they have <hi>begun at the wrong end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Juſtly alſo are they hence blamed, who, although they <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> well with <hi>good thoughts, good wills, good purpoſes,</hi> yet proceed not, <hi>continue not</hi> in their courſe <hi>well begun:</hi> Ye did run well, ſaith <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians, Gal.</hi> 5.7. Theſe he calls his little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, cap. 4.19. And whereas many, in that ſtate, pretend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and complain, that they have no <hi>grace,</hi> no <hi>ſtrength</hi> to <hi>go on</hi> in their <hi>ſpiritual journey;</hi> the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth, that they had <hi>ſtrength;</hi>

So</p>
               <pb n="619" facs="tcp:65717:324"/>
               <p>So that they who pretend, they <hi>want grace</hi> and ſtrength, and ſay, they would go on, <hi>if God would give them grace,</hi> they lay the whole blame of their negligence and improficiency upon God himſelf, whereas indeed they themſelves alone are in the fault.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But more ſharply are they to be reproved who <hi>begin</hi> well, but end ill. The Apoſtle reproved this Apoſtaſie in the Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. Are ye ſo <hi>fooliſh,</hi> that having <hi>begun</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi>

               <p>But we may enlarge this <hi>Reproof,</hi> and extend it unto thoſe, who have <hi>begun</hi> in <hi>that ſpirit,</hi> whereby we <hi>mortifie the deeds of the body, Rom.</hi> 8.13. and go about to be <hi>perfect in the corrupt ſinful fleſh.</hi> Such are they, who having entred, and made good <hi>progreſs</hi> in the <hi>narrow way</hi> of <hi>mortification,</hi> become weary of it, and return to their vomit, of <hi>made holineſs,</hi> which they had caſt up with the <hi>Dog;</hi> and reject the true <hi>holy things:</hi> and with the <hi>Swine,</hi> they tread under their feet the <hi>precious Pearl, Matthew</hi> 13.46. and return to their <hi>wallowing in the mire of ſenſuality,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22.

               <p>THis Text containes precepts of greateſt moment; yea, as the firſt. is here propounded, its of <hi>only</hi> moment, <hi>Only</hi> take heed to thy ſelf, and keep thy ſoul diligently. And the precept of conveying the doctrine to after ages, is of like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Thou ſhalt teach them thy ſons and thy ſons ſons. Which is the ſame, but in a more large ſenſe, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Look to thy ſelf, and the doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words may be conſidered in themſelves, or with reference unto thoſe preceding. In themſelves, they contain two general precepts. The former may be divided into two <hi>formally</hi> differing one from another, but <hi>really one</hi> and the ſame. 1. <hi>Only take heed to thy ſelf.</hi> 2. The next is very like unto it, and indeed the ſame with it, or little differing from it; <hi>And keep thy ſoul diligently.</hi> This is demonſtrated from the end, and the adjunct caution. The end is two wayes expreſſed, and the later the effect of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: 1. <hi>Leſt thou forget the things which thine eyes have ſeen;</hi> and 2. <hi>Leſt they depart from thy heart;</hi> which later will follow, in caſe of our fail in the former.</p>

               <p>In the words are contained theſe divine ſentences.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſeen ſome <hi>things</hi> or <hi>words.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Wherein we muſt enquire, what theſe <hi>things</hi> or <hi>words were;</hi> and how <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſeen them. 1. What they here turn <hi>things,</hi> are properly words, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and indeed ſo to be rendred as I ſhall ſhew anon. Thoſe <hi>things or words,</hi> if we look for 1. In the former part of the Chapter, they are either the Law of the Lord taught by <hi>Moſes,</hi> v. 1.5. Or Examples of the <hi>breach,</hi> and <hi>obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> with their ſuitable events, v. 3. Your <hi>eyes have ſeen</hi> that which the Lord did, becauſe of <hi>Baal-Peor:</hi> For every man which went after <hi>Baal-Peor,</hi> the Lord thy God hath deſtroyed him from the midſt of thee: But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God, are alive all of you this day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>things or words</hi> which their eyes had ſeen, are expreſſed in the tenth Verſe following the words of the Text. Take heed to thy ſelf and keep thy ſoul diligently, leſt thou forget the <hi>things</hi> or <hi>words</hi> which thine eyes have ſeen, &amp;c. <hi>The day when thou ſtoodeſt before the Lord thy God in Horeb, &amp;c.</hi> For the <hi>words,</hi> they had ſeen, are underſtood of thoſe which follow, v. 10. <hi>viz.</hi> the words of the Law, v. 13. <hi>the Ten words, Deut.</hi> 10.4. which therefore <hi>Iſrael</hi> is commanded to convey to their ſons and their ſons ſons.</p>
               <p>Accordingly the LXX have <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>But could Iſrael <hi>ſee words?</hi> The uſe of the <hi>ſight</hi> for <hi>hearing,</hi> is very frequent in Scripture. All the people <hi>ſaw</hi> thoſe <hi>thunderings</hi> or <hi>voyces</hi>

               <pb n="633" facs="tcp:65717:331"/>
               <p>But why muſt Iſrael <hi>ſee theſe things</hi> or <hi>words?</hi> 1. Surely what is <hi>purely divine,</hi> cannot otherwiſe be revealed unto man, but by a <hi>divine Oracle,</hi> could <hi>Plato</hi> ſay.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor can there be an intercourſe between God and man otherwiſe then by <hi>divine words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how could this be truly ſpoken to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> That <hi>their eyes had ſeen the words of God,</hi> namely, the <hi>Decalogue</hi> or <hi>Ten Words,</hi> as they are called? For many of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake, were yet unborn when the <hi>Law</hi> was given, as all under 38 years of age. And how then can it be ſaid of them, that <hi>their eyes had ſeen the Ten Words?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is well known, that the Lord deals with a whole Nation, as with one man; ſo he ſpeaks of <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> of <hi>Elam,</hi> of <hi>Aſſur,</hi> and to <hi>Iſrael</hi> here; <hi>Thine eyes have ſeen.</hi> For although the <hi>perſons</hi> may be diminiſhed or increaſed, yet the <hi>Nation</hi> is the ſame; as a River alwayes <hi>ebbing</hi> or <hi>flowing</hi> is yet the ſame River.</p>
               <p>Beſide, the parents had a charge to tranſmit the knowledge of the <hi>divine words</hi> to their children and poſterity: which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt regard, as if their <hi>own eyes</hi> had ſeen what their Parents convey unto them. Yea, ſucceeding ages accounted what their <hi>forefathers did</hi> or <hi>ſuffered,</hi> to be <hi>ſuffered</hi> or <hi>done</hi> by, and to themſelves. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4. He found him in <hi>Bethel,</hi> and there he ſpake with <hi>Us,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hoſea</hi> many ages afterward.</p>
               <p>However this be true and ſatisfactory, yet are there <hi>inward and ſpiritual words,</hi> and an <hi>inward ſight</hi> of them. What other <hi>words</hi> are they, whereof the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. and the Apoſtle ſpeak, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. Have they not heard? Yea verily; <hi>Their ſound went into all the earth,</hi> and <hi>their words into the ends of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence it followes, that Gods <hi>words are viſible words. S. John</hi> ſaith, as before, That which was <hi>from the beginning,</hi> which we have <hi>heard,</hi> which we have <hi>ſeen with our eyes,</hi> which we have <hi>looked upon,</hi> and our <hi>hands have handled of the word of life.</hi> And again, v. 3. That which <hi>we have ſeen</hi> and heard, declare we unto you. The <hi>Word of life was viſible</hi> unto <hi>S. John</hi> and his fellow Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>For howſoever ſome men may ſatisfie themſelves and others, with ſaying, that <hi>S. John</hi> here ſpeaks of the <hi>dayes of Chriſts fleſh,</hi> when the Apoſtles <hi>ſaw and heard him;</hi> ſurely the ſame may as well be ſaid of thoſe who <hi>apprehended him, ſmote him, crucified him.</hi> For theſe <hi>ſaw him, heard him,</hi> handled him, and <hi>that roughly.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the <hi>humanity</hi> and <hi>fleſh</hi> of Chriſt is no where called the <hi>Word;</hi> but the <hi>Word</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be made fleſh,</hi> and to <hi>dwell in us, John</hi> 1.14. Adde hereunto, that what <hi>S. John ſaw, heard, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> was <hi>from the beginning,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1. Whereas the <hi>fleſh of Chriſt was not from the beginning;</hi> but in time and the fulneſs of time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.</p>
               <pb n="634" facs="tcp:65717:332"/>
               <p>There are <hi>inward and ſpiritual ſenſes,</hi> whereby the man of God <hi>ſees</hi> and <hi>hears, ſavors, taſtes,</hi> and <hi>handles</hi> the <hi>words of God.</hi> Such <hi>ſenſes</hi> there muſt be, becauſe there is an <hi>inward man of the heart;</hi> which muſt not want his due powers and faculties. For ſince his <hi>words</hi> are <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>life, John</hi> 6. how can they be otherwiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived then by <hi>ſpiritual ſenſes?</hi> according to the Apoſtles reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.

                  </note> and he cannot know <hi>them,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>ſpiritually</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. And therefore the perfect men have their <hi>ſenſes</hi> exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>to the diſcerning</hi> of both good &amp; evil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14.</p>
               <p>The words of God are ſure, firm, and certainly <hi>true,</hi> as being <hi>demonſtrable,</hi> and that by the moſt <hi>principal demonſtration,</hi> even from the <hi>evidence of ſenſe; The words which thine eyes have ſeen.</hi> For although the <hi>words</hi> of God are conveyed by <hi>hearing,</hi> whereby faith cometh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. Yet the moſt certain <hi>ſenſe</hi> is that of <hi>ſeeing;</hi> according to that well-known and approved ſpeech of the Poet,
<q>
                     <l>Tardiùs irritant animos demiſſa per aures,</l>
                     <l>Quàm quae ſunt oculis commiſſa fidelibus—</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence proceeds the <hi>tactual, approbative and experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the divine words.</hi> So that unto ſuch <hi>experienced men,</hi> we may appeal; Do you not <hi>ſee this truth?</hi> do you not <hi>handle with your hands this word of life?</hi> do you not <hi>taſte,</hi> that the Lord is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The thing to be <hi>kept,</hi> is <hi>thy ſelf, thy heart, thy ſoul.</hi> Of <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> O man, thou art weak, and the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> which is either <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> or the <hi>principal part</hi> of <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> its weak and tender, and wants <hi>keeping.</hi> And therfore when the Wiſeman gives the ſame precept, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Keep thy heart</hi> with all diligence, he uſeth the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is reaſon alſo why the <hi>heart</hi> ſhould be thus <hi>kept,</hi> from conſideration of the manner, meaſure, and degree of <hi>keeping</hi> it. Which in reaſon muſt ariſe with the excellency of the thing to be <hi>kept;</hi> and what is <hi>kept</hi> in it; as alſo from the <hi>tenderneſs</hi> of it, and danger to be corrupted and loſt. All which conſiderations inforce upon us an <hi>exact keeping,</hi> yea, ſuch a <hi>keeping</hi> as is above all other <hi>keepings</hi> as the marginal reading hath it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. Yea, adde to theſe the Wiſemans reaſon on that place: <hi>Out of the heart are the iſſues of life;</hi> whether we ſpeak of the <hi>natural heart</hi> and the iſſues of it; or of the <hi>moral heart</hi> and the iſſues of it, both are true. For the natural heart is the cauſe of the <hi>natural life, Primum vivens</hi> and <hi>ultimum moriens,</hi> firſt living, laſt dead. And if we ſpeak of the true <hi>life,</hi> it is Chriſt, which is our <hi>life, Col.</hi> 3.4. who <hi>dwels in our hearts</hi> by <hi>faith;</hi> with whom, when he <hi>appears,</hi> we ſhall <hi>appear</hi> in glory. Whereof <hi>S.

And the <hi>righteous man lives by his faith, Hebr.</hi> 10.38. And by <hi>faith his heart is purified, Acts</hi> 15.9. And the <hi>pure in heart</hi> ſee God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. And this is the eternal life, to know thee the only God and whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. So that, whether we underſtand Chriſt our <hi>life,</hi> or our <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> by faith, and <hi>life</hi> by faith, and <hi>purifying</hi> the heart by faith, or ſeeing and knowing God and Chriſt by faith, all theſe refer unto the <hi>heart;</hi> and ſo <hi>out of it are the iſſues of life.</hi> Whence it appears, that the <hi>keeping</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> is a buſineſs of the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world; and therefore, in all reaſon, it requires a <hi>keeping above all keeping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence we may take notice, that, 1. The precept is not, <hi>Take heed or look well to what is thine;</hi> or to thoſe things or perſons that are <hi>about thee;</hi> no, nor is it, look to thy <hi>body;</hi> nor for what is <hi>needful</hi> for thy body; nor for what may be an <hi>ornament</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy body. The precept is directed to <hi>thee,</hi> to <hi>thy heart,</hi> to <hi>thy ſoul,</hi> to thine <hi>immortal ſoul;</hi> which is none of all thoſe things, but <hi>above them all;</hi> and the <hi>taking heed to this,</hi> the <hi>keeping of this,</hi> muſt be <hi>above all</hi> the <hi>keeping of them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="638" facs="tcp:65717:334"/>
               <p n="2">2. Hence it appears, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuppoſed in <hi>Iſrael</hi> a power to <hi>take heed to himſelf</hi> and to <hi>keep</hi> his <hi>heart</hi> and his ſoul diligently. For ſurely <hi>Moſes</hi> would not have given ſuch a ſerious admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Lord, nor would the <hi>wiſe Salomon</hi> directed by the <hi>onely wiſe</hi> God, have injoynd the ſame in vain, that every one ſhould <hi>keep himſelf, his heart, his ſoul diligently,</hi> If no man had power ſo to do.

               <p n="3">3. A man cannot be too ſtrict, too carefull, too diligent in the <hi>keeping</hi> of his own <hi>heart.</hi> He muſt <hi>keep</hi> it with <hi>all keeping,</hi> yea, <hi>above all keeping.</hi> So that what care and regard men have to their houſes, their fields, their treaſures; the ſafety of their wives, their children, their friends, their ſervants; Such care, ſuch vigilancy, yea, greater care, greater regard ought to be had of the <hi>heart.</hi> If theſe muſt be garded, the <hi>heart</hi> muſt be re-garded, the <hi>gards muſt be doubled,</hi> in defence of the <hi>heart.</hi> If we ſet on locks, for the preſervation of our treaſure, we muſt ſet on locks, <hi>double locks</hi> and <hi>barres for the preſervation and keeping of our heart.</hi>
               </p>

It is the true inward <hi>Eve, the Mother of all the Living ones;</hi> which brings forth unto us ſpiritual Children: According to which, whoſoever doth the will of God, he is the <hi>Mother of Chriſt, Matth.</hi> 12.50.

And therefore the wiſeman tells us, that the <hi>hearing ear</hi> and the <hi>ſeeing eye,</hi> the Lord hath made even both of them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.12. Whence our Lord, he that hath an <hi>ear to hear,</hi> ſaith he, let him <hi>hear, Matth.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.9. Thus the <hi>retentive memory</hi> and the heedfull <hi>thoughts</hi> are given unto man as his meet <hi>help before him, Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. Thus the <hi>woman was created for the man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.9. to <hi>bring him forth living children,</hi> and to <hi>keep the houſe of his heart.</hi>

               <p>Thus the <hi>thoughts</hi> are brought under the obedience of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. and they are ſerviceable unto God and Chriſt who is our <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>heed and keep his words, the words of life.</hi> This is the wife of which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks; and thus the Wiſe man gives excellent counſel, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.9.

               </p>
               <p>To prevent ſo great an evil, its needful that we learn an <hi>Art of memory,</hi> a <hi>method and way to keep theſe words;</hi> For certainly, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, we are not able to keep them.</p>
               <p>Herein we muſt proceed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Somewhat that hinders, muſt be removed, and ſome poſitive helpful means uſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the former, I ſhall name ſome impediments of the <hi>natural memory,</hi> and the removal of them, with Analogy unto ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual hindrances and removal of them alſo.</p>
               <p>The <hi>corrupt animal ſpirit</hi> hurts the <hi>natural memory.</hi> And many <hi>unclean ſpirits</hi> there are which deſtroy the <hi>remembrance</hi> of <hi>thoſe words which our eyes have ſeen.</hi> One ye read of in <hi>Mark</hi> 1. Yea, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.2. there's a whole Legion of them in one man who dwels in the <hi>tombs,</hi> even in <hi>dead works.</hi> He cannot be bound with the <hi>bands</hi> and <hi>fetters of the Law,</hi> but he <hi>breaks</hi> them, and <hi>caſts</hi> them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. Such <hi>unclean ſpirits</hi> ye read of, who have deſtroyed the memory of God and his Word, extreamly in theſe laſt dayes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.13, 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.14.27. How needful therefore is it, to diſcern of the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> whether they be of God or not, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Phyſitians ſay, <hi>Delirium &amp; phrenitis cauſat oblivionem;</hi> when the <hi>reaſon</hi> is loſt, the <hi>memory</hi> is loſt. 'Tis the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the guide and rudder of the <hi>ſoul.</hi> The Prodigal for this reaſon, <hi>forgat</hi> his fathers houſe; as it is evident from hence, that afterward he is ſaid to come to himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third hurt of the memory is ſaid to be <hi>negotiorum moles,</hi> incombrance <hi>with many buſineſſes, Mark</hi> 4.19. the cares of this
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:65717:338"/>world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches, and the luſts of other things, choak the word. And therefore the Apoſtle exhorts us to lay aſide every weight, and the ſin that beſets us in every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That which they ſay, helps the <hi>natural memory,</hi> hurts the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> namely, images. For experience hath proved that hereby <hi>forgetfulneſs of God and divine things,</hi> hath crept into the Church of God. Hereby the antient people of God were extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. They made an Idol to help their memory of God, and thereby the loſt it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.19, 20, 21. They made a Calf in <hi>Horeb,</hi> and worſhipped the molten image, &amp;c. Then followes, they forgat God their Saviour. And it is a vain impiety to ſet men to look Pictures and <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>God the Father,</hi> Son, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which draw down the thoughts from conceiving a-right of God to be a <hi>Spirit,</hi> unto corporeal and ſenſible things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Come we to poſitive helps. Certain it is, <hi>Quae curamus, meminimus.</hi> Thoſe things which we take heed unto, and take care of, thoſe even when we are old, we <hi>remember;</hi> eſpecially when we faſten them in our <hi>ſouls by meditation</hi> on them day and night, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>They are wont to preſerve the natural memory, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ointments applyed to the head. Such a <hi>ſpiritual unction</hi> we receive from the holy One, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20. which <hi>remembers us</hi> of all that ever we have done, <hi>John</hi> 4.29. which will teach us all things and bring them to our remembrance, Chap. 14.26.</p>
               <p>For although the <hi>memory</hi> be the <hi>keeper of thoſe words which our eyes have ſeen,</hi> yet <hi>Quis cuſtodiet ipſum cuſtodem?</hi>—who ſhall keep the keeper it ſelf? unleſs God himſelf through faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence keep the <hi>heart and memory,</hi> it will <hi>forget the things which our eyes have ſeen.</hi> And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> exhorts us to <hi>keep our heart above all keeping.</hi> Surely his meaning is not, that we ſhould <hi>keep it above all power we have to keep it;</hi> the <hi>keeping</hi> of the <hi>heart above all keeping,</hi> is the committing of it unto God by <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>reſignation</hi> of our ſelves unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prayer</hi> therefore is to be made unto him by <hi>lifting up the heart and minde unto him:</hi> as <hi>naturally</hi> when we <hi>imagine any thing,</hi> we lift up the <hi>fore-part of our head.</hi> When we would <hi>recall any thing to memory,</hi> we lift up the hinder part of the head towards heaven. From him deſcends every <hi>good giving</hi> and every perfect gift. He it is who preſerves us from all evil; yea, he it is who will <hi>keep our ſoul,</hi> yea, the Lord will preſerve our going out and our comming in, from this time forth and for evermore, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 121.7, 8.</p>
               <pb n="648" facs="tcp:65717:339"/>
               <p>Hitherto we have heard the former precept touching the <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our own hearts,</hi> that we forget not the <hi>words which our eyes have ſeen, and leſt they depart from our heart</hi> all the dayes of our life. We ſhould proceed unto the next Axiom touching the <hi>conveyance</hi> of them to our <hi>ſons and our ſons ſons.</hi> But that precept is more fully delivered, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7. and there I ſhall ſpeak of it, if the Lord will.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord will not</hi> hold him guiltleſs <hi>that taketh his Name in vain.</hi>] The word which we turn, <hi>To hold guiltleſs,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

Other Tranſlations in all languages that I have ſeen, render the words as ours do, or to the ſame effect, as not to <hi>clear from puniſhment.</hi> The phraſe 'tis according to a figure called in Rhetorick <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, containing much more in it, then the words ſeem to expreſs. Such is that in the Poet, <hi>Nec tibi cura canum fuerit poſtrema,</hi>—if applyed to one who ſpent his time in following Hounds: as if he ſhould have ſaid, you ſpend much of your time and care that way. We have like examples in Scripture, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.21. Follow not after vain things, that will <hi>not profit,</hi> he means <hi>Idols;</hi> which not only not <hi>profit,</hi> but do the <hi>greateſt miſchief, Jer.</hi> 32.35. They cauſed their ſons and their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to paſs thorow the fire to <hi>Moloch,</hi> which <hi>I commanded them not:</hi> No, he ſeverely prohibited it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.21. Such a figure we have in theſe words, if underſtood in this ſenſe, <hi>he will not hold him guiltleſs,</hi> that he will <hi>certainly puniſh him.;</hi> he will not leave him unpuniſhed: ſo <hi>Luther</hi> in his tranſlation.

               </p>
               <p>They are ſerviceable unto two ſorts or degrees of men. 1. One <hi>under the Law;</hi> ſuch are acted by the <hi>ſpirit of fear;</hi> and ſo it is a demonſtration, the Lord will not <hi>hold him guiltleſs,</hi> but will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>puniſh him.</hi> 2. Others are <hi>under grace;</hi> and to them the <hi>Law is ſpiritual;</hi> and ſo it is the will of God revealed unto them, that the Lord will not <hi>cleanſe him from his ſins,</hi> who takes his Name in vain. And that its ſuch a revelation <hi>of grace,</hi> appears, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.17. where it is reckoned among all the <hi>names</hi> of God, wherein he declares his goodneſs and grace unto <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>I would now propound the queſtion to the godly Reader, what might be the cauſe of ſo great conſpiracy among the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators in different tongues, that they have enclind to render <gap reason="foreign">

But I much fear, the true reaſon is, men rather deſire to be clear'd from the <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>puniſhment of their ſins, then to be cleanſed from the ſins themſelves.</hi> Is it not ſo? why otherwiſe do ſo many under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Angel <hi>Gabriels</hi> etymologie of the Name <hi>Jeſus, Mat.</hi> 1.2. <hi>For he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins,</hi> rather of the <hi>puniſhments,</hi> then of the <hi>ſins themſelves?</hi> And the like miſ-underſtanding there is of many like places, as I have formerly ſhewen.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why the Lord will not <hi>cleanſe hypocrites</hi> who <hi>bear his name vainly and falſly,</hi> may be, becauſe <hi>hypocriſie pollutes</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files</hi> the name of God, <hi>Ezech</hi> 20.39. they offered <hi>outward ſacrifice</hi> to the true God, yet <hi>inwardly had their idols</hi> in <hi>their hearts,</hi> as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14.2, 3.

               <p>Theſe, and ſuch as theſe he calls <hi>murderers.</hi> For whereas every ſin hath the name from the end, whereat it aimes, and is to be eſteemed according to the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>purpoſe</hi> whence it proceeds; as <hi>wrath, envie</hi> or <hi>hatred</hi> againſt our neighbour may be called <hi>murder;</hi> becauſe they tend thereunto, and the will and purpoſe of him, who is <hi>angry, envious,</hi> or <hi>malitious,</hi> is a <hi>murderous will</hi> and <hi>purpoſe,</hi> although really and in the event, they <hi>murder</hi> not their neighbour.

               <p>What reaſon is there for this? There are in the <hi>heart</hi> theſe three notable parts: 1.

                  </gap>, the <hi>iraſcible,</hi> which anſwers to the <hi>Militia</hi> and Garriſon-ſouldiers, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thoſe impediments and obſtructions. This <hi>iraſcible,</hi> though it be the ſeat of more compounded affections, yet the principle here underſtood is <hi>wrath</hi> or <hi>anger;</hi> which is not ſin, becauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted of God in our nature; and the Pſalmiſt really diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth them, and after him the Apoſtle; <hi>Be angry and ſin not:</hi> Howbeit from the exorbitancy of the <hi>concupiſcible,</hi> the appetite inflamed toward ſomething <hi>deſirable,</hi> and hindred from fruition, naturally there is a boyling of the blood about the <hi>heart,</hi> whence the Queſtor or Treaſurer deſires the help of the <hi>Militia,</hi> the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery, for the removing of the impediment. The <hi>wrath</hi> being kindled, ſometimes burnes exceſſively and beyond meaſure; and it is a ſin.</p>

For proof of this, let the firſt <hi>murder</hi> be examined, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. It was ſuch in Gods ſight, when <hi>Cain</hi> was very <hi>wroth</hi> and his countenance fell. But all that time the Lord was patient and dehorted him, and reaſoned with him, <hi>If thou do well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doeſt not well, ſin lieth at the dore, &amp;c.</hi> All this time <hi>Cain</hi> was guilty before God, and in danger of the judgement; but having performed the outward act, then the Lord denounced his judgement againſt him. This will further appear from Gods different rewards of good or evil works <hi>intended</hi> and <hi>performed.</hi> For ſince God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards every man according to his works, the reward of good works and the puniſhment of the evil <hi>finiſhed</hi> muſt be greater then of the ſame <hi>intended.</hi> God was patient all the time that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was <hi>plotting</hi> the death of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> but when it was effected, then he ſent <hi>Nathan</hi> and denounced his judgement.</p>
               <p>Hence we learn, that 1. The <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>Murdrorum officina,</hi> the fleſh-bank, the <hi>ſlaughterhouſe,</hi> the <hi>murdering den,</hi> wherein the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked one ſlayeth the innocent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.8.</p>

God was in this place, and I knew it not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. There is one <hi>in the midſt</hi> of you, whom ye <hi>know</hi> not. Such an ignorant <hi>manſlayer</hi> was <hi>Paul,</hi> who perſecuted the Lord Jeſus, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. but he obtained mercy, becauſe he did it <hi>ignorantly.</hi> Yea, and he is a patern to them that offend. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.17. The greateſt ſin without <hi>hatred</hi> is pardonable, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. The greateſt good work without <hi>charity</hi> is nothing worth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Yea, in this caſe, the Lord hath made proviſion of a <hi>refuge,</hi> if we have ſlain the <hi>man Chriſt ignorantly,</hi> if we have ſlain him by our unholy and profane <hi>life;</hi> we muſt then fly to <hi>Kadeſh,</hi> that is, unto <hi>holineſs.</hi> This counſel the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> gives, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. and <hi>Daniel</hi> to <hi>Nebuchadnezzer, Dan.</hi> 4.27. This <hi>Kadeſh</hi> is in <hi>Galilee,</hi> that is, <hi>converſion</hi> or <hi>turning about, Jer.</hi> 18.11. Therefore when <hi>S. Peter</hi> having told the Jews, that they had <hi>crucified the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> he directs them to <hi>Galilee,</hi> that is, to <hi>turn to the Lord, Acts</hi> 3.19. This City of <hi>refuge</hi> is on a Mountain, as the Church of God is. <hi>Eſay</hi> 2.2. a ſtate hard to be attained unto.

                  <hi>Theſe ſame</hi> are the words, which the <hi>Lord is commanding,</hi> may be underſtood both wayes, both generally of <hi>all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> and more ſpecially of the <hi>firſt and great Commandement;</hi> which comprehends vertually all the reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now what is the commanding of theſe ſame words? As for this manner of ſpeech, <hi>[I am commanding;]</hi> It is no nice or formal difference, but indeed a material and real one, between theſe two expreſſions, <hi>I command,</hi> and <hi>I am commanding;</hi> For the former imports only a <hi>preſent act;</hi> the later ſignifies the <hi>continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the act.</hi> Ye have a like example v. 2. of this Chapter, and very often elſewhere; where the <hi>act</hi> is put for the <hi>conntinuation of
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:65717:345"/>the act;</hi> which is no doubt a wrong to the holy Text, and that a greater then men at firſt conceive; as I ſhall ſhew more fully hereafter, if the Lord will. For although it ſeem to ſome no more then a circumlocution of the <hi>preſent,</hi> yet we ſhall finde that there is more in it. This will appear in part, by one or two brief Obſervations from theſe words; and ſo I ſhall leave this point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Obſerve hence, what an excellent <hi>Lawgiver</hi> the Lord our God is; he has given Commandements, and he is yet <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them,</hi> he is <hi>yet giving them.</hi> Inferiour Lawgivers, as <hi>Lycurgus, Numa, Solon, &amp;c.</hi> when they have once publiſhed their Lawes, they leave them to the people to obſerve them at their peril. Not ſo the Lord our <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> as he is called, <hi>Eſay</hi> 33.22. He gives <hi>Lawes,</hi> and <hi>Lawes</hi> for publication of thoſe <hi>Lawes,</hi> and himſelf is <hi>ſtill giving them.</hi> Artificers having done their work, they leave it to the care of others whom it concerns; as the <hi>Carpenter</hi> having built an <hi>houſe,</hi> he takes no more thought for it. The <hi>Shipwright</hi> having made a <hi>veſſel</hi> fit to ſail, it concerns him no more, whether it <hi>ſink</hi> or <hi>ſwim.</hi> The <hi>Husbandman</hi> having planted a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> he leaves it to the weather, and to the ordinary providence of God. Our moſt gracious God having done any <hi>ſpiritual work</hi> like theſe, or any of theſe, though he has <hi>done</hi> it, yet he has not <hi>ſo done</hi> it, but that he is <hi>ſtill doing it.</hi>

               <p>And ſo <hi>theſe ſame words</hi> are to be underſtood here to be <hi>upon our hearts,</hi> and <hi>upon our Spirits,</hi> when we <hi>actually think of them,</hi> have them <hi>preſent</hi> in our <hi>mindes, wills</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> and are in a <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It we inquire into the reaſon why <hi>theſe ſame</hi> words muſt be in or <hi>upon</hi> our hearts, we ſhall finde them exceedingly neceſſary and behoofull for us; For indeed, through our fall, we have a dark heart and blinde eyes; Yee were darkneſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. and he that walketh in <hi>darkneſs,</hi> knoweth not whither he goeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.35. And therefore there is great need of the pure and holy commandement of the Lord which is a Lamp and the law a light, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.23. Which is <hi>inlightning the eyes, Pſal.</hi> 19.8. 2. And whereas the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>ſoule</hi> has gon a ſtray, and <hi>loſt it ſelf,</hi> the law of the Lord is perfect <hi>converting</hi> or <hi>reſtoring the ſoul.</hi> 3. And whereas the heart is defiled, and who can ſay, (for he is a very rare man who can ſay,) <hi>my heart is clean, theſe ſame words</hi> bring with them the <hi>fear of God, Exod.</hi> 20.20. Which is <hi>clean, Pſal.</hi> 19. and cleanſeth the heart, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. and perfects the holyneſs and purity of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And whereas there is a kinde of <hi>Acidia,</hi> as it's called in the <hi>School,</hi> a deadneſs and lazineſs in regard of our cold affections unto any ſpiritual good, <hi>theſe ſame words,</hi> are <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>fiery words,</hi> ſuch as come out of the <hi>fire</hi> tryed and proved, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.33. And therefore they are called a <hi>fiery law, Deut.</hi> 33.2. Even the law of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> which is as <hi>fire, Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Theſe ſame fiery words enflame the heart,</hi> and make it <hi>zealous</hi> and <hi>ready</hi> to every good work.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And leaſt the heart ſhould be tranſported with an heady <hi>zeal</hi> without a <hi>guide,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>wild fire,</hi> or <hi>Ignis fatuus; theſe ſame words</hi> regulate our <hi>zeal, Gal.</hi> 4.18. They ſtere the courſe of our whole <hi>life;</hi> and therefore they are ſaid to be <hi>our life, Prov.</hi> 3.22.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And as the naturall <hi>heart</hi> is ſeated as a King in the midſt of the body; So theſe ſame words ſit in the <hi>heart,</hi> and rule it with divine <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and make it a <hi>wiſe and underſtanding heart.</hi> Theſe ſame words ſatisfy the <hi>ſoul</hi> which is commonly taken for the <hi>deſire.</hi> And becauſe the affections are ſeated <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But touching <hi>theſe ſame words</hi> in, or upon the <hi>heart,</hi> I ſpake ſomewhat on <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9. Come we now to the tranſmitting of

               <p>Two things are to be inquired into; 1. what theſe <hi>children</hi> are, which indeed are to be turned <hi>ſons.</hi> 2. What it is to <hi>whet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. By <hi>ſons</hi> whether natural or ſpiritual, we are to underſtand ſuch as are to be begotten unto God, by the immortal ſeed of the word; ſuch are diſciples. Thus R. <hi>Solomon</hi> interprets them the <hi>ſons of the Prophets.</hi> And ſo <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt had his <hi>ſons,</hi> thus <hi>Simon</hi> is called the ſon of <hi>Jonah, Joſh.</hi> 1.42. <hi>Jonah</hi> is the Syriack contraction of <hi>Johanna,</hi> as may appear from hence, that whereas our Lord had called <hi>Peter, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſon of <hi>Jonah,</hi> he calls him thrice, without contraction, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſon of <hi>John;</hi> ſo St. <hi>Hierom, Joh.</hi> 21.15, 16, 17. <hi>Simon fili Johannis.</hi> And accordingly Nonnus in his paraphraſe, hath thoſe words, thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Simon thou ſon of John father divine.</hi> The miniſters of God are <hi>fathers</hi> unto thoſe whom they beget unto God and Chriſt; thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>Corinthians</hi> his <hi>ſons,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14. as my beloved <hi>ſons</hi> I warn you: For, though ye have ten thouſand <hi>inſtructors</hi> in Chriſt, yet ye have not many <hi>fathers;</hi> for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you, through the Goſpel. And thus he calls the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> his <hi>little Children, Gal.</hi> 4.19.</p>
               <p>Now what is it to <hi>whet theſe ſame words</hi> upon our <hi>ſons. David Kimchi</hi> turns it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>aſſignè loqui, to ſpeak dayly of them.</hi> One old Engliſh Tranſlator, who turns the phraſe to <hi>whet</hi> the commandements upon our <hi>children,</hi> explains it by <hi>exerciſing</hi> them in <hi>ſpeaking</hi> and <hi>hearing,</hi> and cauſing them to <hi>practiſe</hi> them in their <hi>living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The metaphore is taken from ſouldiers, ſaith <hi>Tremellius,</hi> who <hi>whet</hi> their weapons that they may eaſily pierce into their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: And ſo the Lord commands <hi>parents</hi> to propound the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of God</hi> unto their <hi>children quàm accommodatiſſimè,</hi> moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently for their profit. So he.</p>

               <p>To <hi>whet</hi> or <hi>ſharpen,</hi> is to <hi>work off the ruſt and ſoyl</hi> that cleaves to ſword, knife or other weapon, tool or inſtrument, to make it bright, to make it <hi>ſharp,</hi> to ſet an <hi>edge</hi> upon it, to make it fit to <hi>pierce,</hi> and <hi>cut.</hi> This is done by often and often <hi>repetition,</hi> by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating</hi> again and again of <hi>theſe ſame words.</hi> The book of Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy may have the name from the <hi>frequent iterating, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, inculcating, and ſo whetting and ſharpening theſe ſame words</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the ſons of Iſrael.</hi> For howſoever there ſeems to be a frequent <hi>rehearſing</hi> of the ſame things over and over, yet if it be well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the <hi>main concluſion,</hi> that is principally aimed at in that Book, is, that we hearken to the voice of the Lord, obey and do the commandements, which <hi>concluſion</hi> is inferred by great variety of arguments; which the divine Logitian, who is taught by the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>the inward and living word,</hi> can eaſily underſtand and diſtinguiſh. And becauſe others know them not, that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Book</hi> ſeems irkſome and tedious unto them; though <hi>theſe ſame words</hi> be <hi>Gospel words;</hi> and ſo much is intimated by the often repetition of <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>There is reaſon for tranſmitting of <hi>theſe ſame words</hi> unto poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whether we conſider <hi>theſe ſame words;</hi> or Iſrael in <hi>whoſe heart theſe ſame words are;</hi> or the <hi>ſons of Iſrael,</hi> on whom they muſt <hi>whet</hi> and <hi>ſharpen theſe ſame words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As for <hi>theſe ſame words;</hi> they are not proper to any one perſon, or nation, or age, but common and coextenſive to all perſons, nations and ages. So ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.142. Thy righteouſneſs is an <hi>everlaſting righteouſnſes, and thy law is the truth,</hi> and ver. 144. <hi>the righteouſneſs of thy teſtimonies is everlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Iſrael <hi>in whoſe heart theſe ſame words are,</hi> has received them, and that not for himſelf only; but he ows to his <hi>ſons, Eſſe neutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum &amp; inſtructivum,</hi> as the ſchool ſpeaks, <hi>nutrimentum &amp; docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum, nouriſhment, and nurture or education.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>ſons of Iſrael</hi> have an equal ſhare in the promiſes of God, with their <hi>fathers,</hi> as being made to them and to their ſeed <hi>for ever;</hi> and <hi>alike capable</hi> they are of <hi>Gods image,</hi> and the <hi>divine nature</hi> promoted and advanced by <hi>theſe ſame words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But muſt Iſrael <hi>teach</hi> only <hi>thoſe ſame words?</hi> Muſt he <hi>whet</hi> no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words upon his <hi>ſons?</hi> What think we of tongues and arts and other ſecular learning? Muſt Iſrael <hi>ſharpen thoſe words</hi> upon his <hi>ſons</hi> or not?</p>
               <p>It is true, that ſecular learning is exceeding uſeful; but as an <hi>handmaid,</hi> not as a <hi>miſtreſs;</hi> no, by no means. And therefore
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:65717:347"/>if <hi>Hagar</hi> be proud and ſaucy (as ſhe has been long in the Church) her <hi>miſtreſs Sarah</hi> muſt chaſten and correct her; yea, and if ſhe will not humble her ſelf, turn her out of doores, till ſhe learn better manners. <hi>Hagar</hi> ſignifies <hi>advena, peregina,</hi> a <hi>ſtranger.</hi> Now Iſrael might entertain <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to be <hi>ſervants</hi> unto them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.45. And what do theſe ſtrangers ſignifie in their myſtery, but <hi>forraign arts and tongues and other learnings</hi> of the <hi>ſtrange nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which <hi>Sarah the Lady</hi> (as her name imports) may receive into her <hi>ſervice;</hi> and very <hi>ſerviceable Hagar</hi> may be in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe; but ſhe muſt not pride her ſelf, above her miſtreſs; no, nor equalize her ſelf unto her, this <hi>ſervant</hi> muſt not abide in the houſe always, <hi>John</hi> 8. When <hi>Iſaac</hi> is born and growen up, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> and her ſon <hi>Iſhmael</hi> muſt be both thruſt out of doors, <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Hear what the law ſaith; when thou ſeeſt among the captives a beautiful woman, and haſt a deſire unto her, that thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have her to wife, <hi>Then thou ſhalt bring her home to thine houſe;</hi>

                  <hi>and ſhe ſhall ſhave her head and</hi> pare her nails.] As to the literal meaning of theſe words, what is here turned to <hi>pare her nails,</hi> is, word for word, <hi>make her nails.</hi> Now whether to <hi>make her nails,</hi> be to <hi>pare and cut them off,</hi> or to <hi>let them grow,</hi> it is much queſtioned. And the Tranſlators themſelves ſeem to have been divided concerning this queſtion, ſince they put the one in the <hi>Text,</hi> and the other in the <hi>margent;</hi> but as unhappily, as often elſewhere; for, beſide the reaſon intimated before, that to <hi>make nails,</hi> as it is in the Hebrew, is rather to let them <hi>grow,</hi> then to <hi>cut them off;</hi> the <hi>end</hi> here aimed at, <hi>viz. to deform the captive maid;</hi> leſt he who hath a deſire toward her, ſhould <hi>perditè ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> be too much enamoured with her; that <hi>end</hi> requires unhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs, and uncomelineſs in her; that thereby the heat of his affection might be cooled, taken off and abated. Now that this <hi>end</hi> is here intended, appears by the context; wherein it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that this maid be <hi>ſhaven;</hi> which would be a <hi>ſhame</hi> unto her; as on the contrary, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to <hi>nouriſh her hair, let it grow,</hi> and ſo to have long hair, is a <hi>glory to the woman,</hi> as <hi>her comely</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.6.15. Beſide, the law ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. ſhe ſhall put of the rayment of her captivity from her; (wherewith her Amoretto was taken;) then ſhe muſt be in <hi>ſordibus,</hi> in mourning attire, a full moneth, for her father and her mother.

And thus the learned Jews underſtood this law.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the <hi>law is ſpiritual,</hi> St. <hi>Hierome</hi> underſtood by this maid, the <hi>learning of the Gentils,</hi> which hath a raviſhing beauty, and <hi>capta capit, being taken, it is much taking alſo;</hi> and wins very much upon mens affections; and very great danger

And <hi>S. Paul</hi> a very learned man in <hi>Arts and Languages,</hi> as appears in all his Epiſtles, was a <hi>ſervant</hi> of God in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of his Son; and the Lord found uſe for both kinds of <hi>learning</hi> in his Church; and both may be taught as ſerviceable unto <hi>theſe ſame words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Obſerve with how great caution, how warily <hi>Moſes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Commandements of God unto Iſrael, to be conveyed unto their <hi>ſons;</hi> they muſt be <hi>theſe ſame words. Moſes</hi> no doubt foreſaw, that there would be a generation who ſhould afterward teach for <hi>doctrines the commandements of men;</hi> as the Phariſees and Scribes laid aſide the Commandement of God, and held the tradition of men, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.8. That if they own'd the <hi>Law,</hi> yet ſo as to pick and chooſe among the <hi>Ten Commandements</hi> of God, take ſome one, and reject all the reſt.

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I intend not to treat of all theſe, having ſpoken to many of them upon their Texts of Scripture. Wherefore I ſhall waive
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:65717:354"/>the Preſs handling of what I have formerly delivered, and ſpeak to what more properly concerns our preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lords firſt <hi>Requeſt</hi> to Iſrael is, to <hi>fear</hi> the Lord their God. But what <hi>fear</hi> of the Lord, is here underſtood? And why is that <hi>fear</hi> his <hi>firſt Requeſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>fear</hi> of the Lord here meant, is not only <hi>ſervile;</hi> which is a neceſſary <hi>introduction</hi> unto a better; but <hi>filial, initial,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous fear</hi> alſo, which hath the temper of <hi>love</hi> with it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>fear</hi> of the Lord, is his <hi>firſt Requeſt</hi> unto Iſrael; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>fear</hi> and reverence properly belongs to his <hi>ſoveraignty</hi> and ſupream Majeſty, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. For it is the property of <hi>Saviraigns</hi> to expect <hi>reverence</hi> from their Subjects. To this <hi>man</hi> will I look, to the poor <hi>(or humble)</hi> and <hi>broken of ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>trembling</hi> at my word; <hi>viz.</hi> ſo <hi>trembling</hi> as the balances <hi>in aequi pondio,</hi> when they are one weight, ready to turn with the weight of the word. And therefore this <hi>fear</hi> of the Lord appertains <hi>ad primam menſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram divinitatis, quae janua eſt ad intrandum in palatium Regis,</hi> to the <hi>firſt meaſure</hi> of the Deity, which is the <hi>gate and in-let</hi> into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the great King, ſaith <hi>Georgius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enetus,</hi> out of the antient Divines. Hence it is, that this <hi>fear</hi> of the Lord, is ſaid by <hi>David,</hi> to be the beginning of divine Wiſdom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.10. which is confirmed by his wiſe ſon <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p>Here is then the <hi>firſt ſervice of the Lord,</hi> and his <hi>firſt Requeſt</hi> unto Iſrael; to <hi>fear</hi> the Lord his God, <hi>Ezod.</hi> 20.20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>fear</hi> of the Lord is the principle of <hi>walking in all his wayes:</hi> That's the Lords <hi>ſecond Requeſt.</hi> And what are thoſe wayes? There are many of them, but they may be reduced unto three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a way of Gods Commandements, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.1.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 1. and 128. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</note> O <hi>the bleſſedneſſes of the perfect in the way,</hi> walking in the <hi>Law</hi> of the Lord, wherein they walk who <hi>fear</hi> the Lord. <hi>O the bleſſedneſſes of every one fearing the Lord, walking in his wayes.</hi> This is the <hi>way</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>way</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> which is Chriſt: For ſo the Lord ſaith of himſelf, I am <hi>the way, John</hi> 14.6. and <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>faith in him,</hi> are promiſcuouſly taken ſometime, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23, 24, 25. And this is the <hi>way</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>way of love,</hi> a moſt <hi>excellent way,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and yet I declare unto you <hi>a way,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 31. and 13.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum excellentiam, according to eminency</hi> and <hi>excellency.</hi> What that <hi>way</hi> is, the Apoſtle ſhewes in the following Chapter; If I ſpeak with the tongues of men and Angels, but have not <hi>love</hi> (or <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>) &amp;c. Whereby its evident, that Archbiſhop <hi>Stephen Langhton,</hi> who divided the <hi>Scriptures</hi> into <hi>Chapters,</hi> though elſewhere very happily moſt what; yet herein he violently brake the laſt verſe of the twelfth Chapter, from the firſt of the thirteenth. For the
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:65717:355"/>Apoſtle in the laſt verſe of the twelfth Chapter, begins a new argument or ſubject diſtinct, by way of excellency, from the former part of that Chapter, which he proſecutes Chap. 13.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>third way,</hi> the <hi>way of love,</hi> the <hi>way</hi> of the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel, Matth.</hi> 24.14. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.6.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whence it appears, that the fear of the Lord, is only a ſoveraign and effectual preſervative <hi>againſt ſin,</hi> according to that of the Wiſeman, The <hi>fear of the Lord</hi> driveth out ſin, and wrath, <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 1.26. And, by the <hi>fear of the Lord, men depart from evil.</hi> But alſo it is a means as helpful for the advancement and promoting of every <hi>poſitive good,</hi> as here, for the <hi>walking in all the wayes of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord expecteth of Iſrael, an univerſal obedience, a walking in <hi>all his wayes;</hi> obedience of <hi>fear, Exod.</hi> 20.20. Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>faith, Rom.</hi> 1.5. and 16.26.

               <p n="1">1. Whence they are juſtly to be reproved who have all the <hi>wayes of the Lord</hi> propounded unto them <hi>to walk in,</hi>

And therefore, ſince <hi>è malis moribus, ortaeſunt bonae leges, good lawes ariſe from,</hi> and ſuppoſe <hi>ill manners of men;</hi> hence it is, that they are propounded <hi>imperatively,</hi> and have their due and reſpective <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> by <hi>puniſhments</hi> annexed.

               <p>The Lord having given ſo many <hi>affirmative</hi> and <hi>negative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> he <hi>contracts</hi> them unto <hi>ten,</hi> which are the <hi>Decalogue,</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Commandements</hi> can be but once more <hi>contracted, viz.</hi> unto one; and that's done by <hi>S. Paul, Rom.</hi> 13.9, 10.

               <p>When we read, that our God <hi>entreats</hi> us to <hi>fear</hi> him, walking in all his wayes, <hi>love</hi> him, <hi>ſerve</hi> him, and <hi>keep his Commandements</hi> and his ſtatutes; and further that <hi>Moſes Commands</hi> all theſe, we might think, that God and <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſome <hi>notable ends</hi> upon us; That God would not <hi>requeſt,</hi> nor <hi>Moſes require</hi> theſe duties of us, but for <hi>their own great advantage.</hi> Whereas indeed the <hi>end</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at all theſe aime, which the Lords <hi>entreates,</hi> and <hi>Moſes's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> tend unto, is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And in this <hi>end, where at all the whole creation aimes,</hi> or, <hi>ought to aim,</hi> the <hi>good</hi> of Iſrael, is involved. And therefore there is added, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Whence it appears, that the obedience to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, is comprehended in <hi>true ſelf-love,;</hi> For as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Chriſtian Religion, is <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> denial of the <hi>falſe ſelf-love, Luke</hi> 9.23.

               </p>
               <p>Does the Lord <hi>entreat us, petition us,</hi> yea, <hi>beg</hi> all this of us, and that <hi>for good, for our own good,</hi> O Iſrael? Does <hi>Moſes command</hi> all this, this day? Let us <hi>command our ſelves</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> what <hi>Moſes

               <p>There is an overture toward this, in thine <hi>immortall ſoul,</hi> O Iſrael!

               <p>This Tranſlation leads unto a great errour; as if the yong <hi>Lamb for the Paſſeover,</hi> were here changed into a grown <hi>Sheep,</hi> or an <hi>Ox;</hi> which at firſt was inſtituted by the Lord, to be a <hi>Lamb</hi> or <hi>Kid of the firſt year, Exod.</hi> 12-3.5.

               <p>Some of the learned Jewes were of this opinion. And they feigned a reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe in a great family, one <hi>Lamb</hi> or <hi>Kid</hi> was no enough. And therefore they conceived, that the Lord here exchanged a <hi>yong Lamb</hi> or <hi>Kid</hi> for a <hi>growen Sheep or Ox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Lord himſelf wiſely foreſaw, and graciouſly provided for ſuch a caſe, as appears, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.4. If the <hi>houſhold be too little for the Lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his houſe,</hi> take it, according to the number of the ſouls, &amp;c. Beſide, the <hi>Lamb for the Paſſeover,</hi> was not ordained for the filling of their <hi>bellies,</hi> but for a <hi>thankful memorial of their deliverance out of Egypt;</hi> that the heart might be eſtabliſhed with <hi>grace,</hi>

               <p>But why then are <hi>Sheep and Oxen,</hi> here added, if they be not the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> or a part of it? I anſwer, The Lords Sacrifices were to be offered in their appointed times. Howbeit, beſide the preciſe obſervation of every reſpective <hi>offering,</hi> there were certain <hi>incidental oblations,</hi> which, though <hi>offered unto God,</hi> the ſame day, yet they properly appertained not unto the ſervice and <hi>offering</hi> of that day. Thus the <hi>daily burnt offering</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be <hi>offered</hi> day by day continually, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.38.—42. Yet beſide the <hi>daily burnt offering,</hi> other <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were <hi>offered;</hi> which diſtinguiſhed from it; as we read expreſly, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. where the <hi>continual burnt offering</hi> is again enjoyn'd, ver. 3.—8. But every Sabbath day had its proper ſervice and <hi>offering,</hi> ver. 9. which yet did not diſcontinue, nor yet was it co-incident with the <hi>daily burnt offering,</hi> but diſtinguiwed from it, ver. 10. <hi>This is</hi> the <hi>burnt offering</hi> of every <hi>Sabbath,</hi> beſide the <hi>continual burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> and his drink-offering. The like is obſervable in the <hi>obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> at the beginnings of the moneths, ver. 11. which were <hi>offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
                  <pb n="695" facs="tcp:65717:362"/>beſide the <hi>continual burnt offering,</hi> ver. 15. So in the day of the firſt fruits, ver. 26. the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> proper to that day muſt be beſide the <hi>continual burnt offering,</hi> ver. 31.</p>
               <p>The like may be noted in the ſolemnity of the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> it ſelf; which, as it was to be obſerved apart and beſide the <hi>daily burnt offering,</hi> ver. 23.24. So likewiſe was the ſervice and duty of that day, ſacred from the proper ſervices and <hi>offerings</hi> of the <hi>feaſt of unleavened bread:</hi> For ſo ver. 16. on the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth, is the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> of the Lord. And in the fifteenth day of this moneth, is the <hi>feaſt,</hi> according to the firſt inſtitution, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.14, 15. So that on the fourteenth day the <hi>Paskal Lamb</hi> only was ſlain and eaten; but on the <hi>feaſt of unleavened bread,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning on the fifteenth day, and continuing ſeven days, were <hi>Sacrifices offered of Bullocks, Rams, and Lambs, Numb.</hi> 28.18.—24.</p>
               <p>Whence its evident, that where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, Thou ſhalt <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the Paſſeover,</hi> of the flock and of the herd; he ſpeaks compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly of the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> it ſelf, and the <hi>Sacrifices of the feaſt of unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread,</hi> annexed thereunto.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have conſidered the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>rule of the Paſſeover.</hi> Practiſe and example will beſt expound that <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> which we finde 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.15. Where its ſaid, that they <hi>killed the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> on the fourteenth day of the ſecond moneth, (<hi>Num.</hi> 9.10.11.) And the Prieſts and the Levites were aſhamed and ſanctified themſelves, and brought in the <hi>burnt offerings</hi> into the houſe of the Lord. Firſt, they are ſaid to have <hi>killed the Paſſeover;</hi> then the Prieſts and Levites aſhamed (of their uncleanneſs) brought in the <hi>burnt offerings</hi> into the houſe of the Lord; which muſt be underſtood of thoſe <hi>offered</hi> in the <hi>feaſt of unleavened bread:</hi> For we read of no other preſcribed in the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> but one <hi>Lamb</hi> or <hi>Kid;</hi> and this <hi>Rite and Ceremony</hi> is ſaid to have been performed according to the <hi>law of Moſes</hi> the man of God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.15, 16.</p>
               <p>There is another example which ſpeaks more home to this purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Paſſeover</hi> of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> whereof its ſaid, Surely there was not ſuch a <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> from the dayes of the Judges, that judged Iſrael, nor in all the dayes of the Kings of Iſrael, nor of the Kings of Judah, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.22. This <hi>Paſſeover</hi> is related more particularly, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.1.—19. where expreſs mention is made of <hi>killing the Paſſeover</hi> in the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth, ver. 1. which conſiſted of <hi>Lambs and kids,</hi> according to <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. The King alſo is ſaid, beſide the <hi>Paſſeover offerings,</hi> to have given to the people 3000 <hi>Bullocks,</hi> ver. 7.

               <p>The diſtinct wayes of dreſſing theſe <hi>offerings</hi> prove this; for ver. 13. they <hi>roſted the Paſſeover</hi> (which is ſaid before to conſiſt of

               </p>
               <p>By all which, it appears, that, although mention be made of the <hi>flock and the herd,</hi> yet by theſe are not to be underſtood the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> (which was offered by it ſelf) but the <hi>offerings</hi> annexed thereunto in the <hi>feaſt of unleavened bread,</hi> v. 17.</p>
               <p>I could wiſh therefore, that <hi>[of]</hi> were <hi>left</hi> out, and the words read thus; Thou ſhalt therefore <hi>ſacrifice the Paſſeover unto the Lord thy God, Sheep and Ox.</hi>

               <p>The Lord having commanded the building of three <hi>Cities of Refuge,</hi> in the <hi>midſt</hi> of the Land, v. 2.

               <p>Before we can ſpeak as we ought, to theſe words, we muſt render them right: For they are not truly tranſlated, as they are now read. I read them thus.

               <p>This diſcovers mans wonderful apoſtaſie from the <hi>love</hi> of his God; who, although he be the <hi>chief good,</hi> and therefore <hi>naturally moſt amiable and lovely,</hi> yet the Lord ſees it needful to <hi>command</hi> man to love him.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Its ſtrange, that there hath been ſo great an inadvertency in the Authors of all the old Engliſh Tranſlations, as well as of this laſt; as alſo in the French, Spaniſh, and Italian; yea, in <hi>Hierom</hi> alſo, in <hi>Luther,</hi> and the Low Dutch; that they ſhould not take notice of the <hi>ſingular number,</hi> this <hi>Commandement,</hi> which would have directed them to the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>great Commandement</hi> in the next words.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, a matter of ſo great moment, paſt not without due obſervation of ſome learned Tranſlators, as <hi>Pagnin, Vatablus, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellio, Tremellius, Munſter,</hi> the Tigurin Bible, <hi>Piſcator,</hi> and of our Engliſh, <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> who with one conſent read the words to one effect, Thou ſhalt keep all <hi>that Commandement</hi> to <hi>do it; viz.</hi> to love the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Herein we muſt inquire, 1. What it is, to <hi>keep that Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement;</hi> which is the duty here commanded; 2. What it is to keep <hi>all that Commandement;</hi> which is the latitude and generality of the duty.</p>
               <p>To <hi>keep that Commandement,</hi> and <hi>do</hi> it, are phraſes ſometime equipollent and of the ſame extent; for ſo to keep the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, is to do the Commandement.</p>
               <p>Sometime they are diſtinguiſhed; and the former is in order to the later, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.6. and 5.1. Ye ſhall learn them, and keep to do them.</p>
               <p>And thus the obſerving and keeping the Commandement is in or with the <hi>heart,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.34. I ſhall keep thy Law; yea, I ſhall obſerve it <hi>in the whole heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then I commend unto you the higheſt ſervice of God, even the <hi>love of the Lord our God.</hi> That ye may perceive it to be no other, ye may conſider the man on whom God <hi>firſt</hi> works, to be moved by the <hi>ſpirit of bondage,</hi> under which he lives in <hi>fear,

Fear takes away half the underſtanding from ſervants, ſaith <hi>Plato,</hi> out of <hi>Homer.</hi> Yea, <hi>Timor minuit,</hi> it takes away half their ſtrength. A man is not able to do half ſo much in his <hi>fear,</hi> as when it is off him. Then is he brought to <hi>faith,</hi> but that works not, but by <hi>love, Gal.</hi> 5.6.

               <p>
                  <hi>Doubt.</hi> 1. But how can we <hi>love</hi> the Lord our God ſo intenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and extenſively, and keep <hi>all this Commandement</hi> to do it? God is immenſe, unmeaſurable, and infinite. But thou, and I, and
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:65717:367"/>every creature of us is finite and hath certain <hi>bounds and limits of being.</hi> Between <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>finite,</hi> we ſay, there is no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               </p>
               <p>Beloved! we are ſubject to be much miſtaken, as in other things, ſo moſt of all, in <hi>ourſelves:</hi> The man was taken, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his better part, out of his God, &amp; therefore he hath greater reſemblance unto him, then he is aware of. God is <hi>infinite;</hi> and man is, in a ſort, <hi>infinite; Infinite in his thoughts and imaginations.</hi> Name the utmoſt part of the known World, of the Eaſtern or Weſtern Indies; or toward the Northern of Southern Pole, the <hi>thoughts</hi> are preſently there upon the very firſt naming of them. Put caſe there were more Worlds, and thoſe larger then this known World; the <hi>thoughts</hi> could enlarge themſelves according to the number of them, and utmoſt extent of them.</p>
               <p>The like we may ſay of the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>appetite,</hi> it is <hi>infinite, Eccleſ.</hi> 6.7. All the labour of the man is for his mouth; and his <hi>appetite</hi> or <hi>will</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) is not filled; no, but it ranges and ſeeks about for what may <hi>fill</hi> it: as the Wiſeman intimates, v. 9. Better is the <hi>ſight of the eyes</hi> then the <hi>wandring of the deſire.</hi> Yea, by reaſon of the <hi>unſatiable</hi> and <hi>infinite appetite,</hi> the eye is not ſatisfied with ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor the ear with hearing, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.8. nor the <hi>deſire</hi> with luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

               <p>As therefore God himſelf is <hi>infinite;</hi> ſo is the <hi>deſire</hi> an <hi>abyſs,</hi> a bottomleſs <hi>depth</hi> which cannot be <hi>filled</hi> otherwiſe then by an <hi>infinite</hi> God.

For God in himſelf is an <hi>infinite good</hi> without any defect; and the ſoul was made according to his image, and for this end, to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>love him:</hi> and, till it ſo do, it rambles and wanders about the <hi>creatures,</hi> and is never ſatisfied. <hi>Feciſti nos Domine propter te, &amp; irrequietum eſt cor nostrum donec pervenerit ad te.</hi> Lord! thou haſt made us for <hi>thy ſelf.</hi> And our heart is <hi>unquiet</hi> until it come unto <hi>Thee.</hi>

               <p>That which the <hi>firſt</hi> recited of all theſe four parts ofthe <hi>Law,</hi> was this <hi>Commandement</hi> touching the <hi>love of the Lord our God.</hi> This they <hi>firſt</hi> recited every morning and every evening; and <hi>thence</hi> it is moſt worthy of our morning and evening meditation.

I have ſeen an <hi>end of all perfection, thine exceeding broad Commiandement.</hi> The Text is corrupted by the Tranſlation: There is no <hi>[But]</hi> no diverſity at all; but the later part explains the former. This is the <hi>end</hi> of the Commandement. The <hi>end</hi> or <hi>perfection</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, is <hi>love</hi> out of a <hi>pure heart,</hi> and a <hi>good conſcience and faith unfeigned,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5.

               <p n="2">2. The Lord ſo ſpeaks to <hi>all</hi> Iſrael, as to <hi>one</hi> man; If thou keep <hi>all this Commandement,</hi> to <hi>do it,</hi> to <hi>love</hi> the Lord thy God; the Lord requires obedience unto <hi>this Commandement of all,</hi> and of <hi>every man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>Whence we may juſtly reprove a wicked generation of men, who being exhorted to <hi>keep the Commandement</hi> to this end <hi>to do it,</hi> they limit the will of the Holy One of Iſrael. And, whereas the Lord commands us to <hi>keep all</hi> that <hi>Commandement,</hi> to <hi>love him with all our heart, minde, ſoul,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> they love him with their <hi>minde</hi> only.

                  </gap>) I <hi>do not;</hi> but the <hi>evil</hi> which I <hi>will</hi> not, that I do. And, I finde therefore a law that <hi>evil lies neer me being willing</hi> to do <hi>good,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) &amp; diverſe other places in that <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. The words, ye perceive, are turnd, as if the Apoſtle ſpake here of a <hi>velleity,</hi> or <hi>half-will;</hi> the <hi>good</hi> that <hi>I would,</hi> the <hi>evil</hi> that <hi>I would not.</hi> There's no ſuch matter; the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a <hi>compleat and full will,</hi> and that which hath no hindrance from it ſelf; the good that I <hi>will;</hi> the evil which I <hi>will not.</hi> This man he has a will compleat and ready to do what good he wills, and to depart from the evil which he wills not. Yea, I <hi>delight,</hi> ſaith he, in the Law of God, according to the inward man; and, whereas he hath ſuch a good will to the <hi>good,</hi> and ſo <hi>delights in it,</hi> and ſo <hi>hates the evil,</hi> to do that evil, its <hi>captivity,</hi> its <hi>miſery,</hi> its <hi>death,</hi> its a <hi>body of death unto him.</hi> And therefore he complaines, Wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this <hi>death?</hi> And he hath anſwer (according to the antient reading of <hi>S. Ambroſe, Origen, S. Hierom, S. Auguſtin,</hi> and others, and the preſent Vulg. Latin,) <hi>Gratia Dei per Dominum Ieſum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum,</hi> the <hi>grace</hi> of God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. And by that <hi>grace,</hi> he is made free from the <hi>Law of ſin and death,</hi> by the Law of the ſpirit of life.</p>
               <p>Is it thus with this perverſe and ſinful generation, who pretend a <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>good will</hi> to ſerve the Law of God? Does not their life declare them? Does not their practice plainly ſpeak, what their <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>will</hi> is? Does not the <hi>ſhew of their countenance</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie againſt them? or rather, as it is in the Hebrew, does not <hi>the acknowledgement of their faces anſwer</hi> againſt them? Do they not declare their ſin like <hi>Sodom?</hi> they hide it not. Wo unto their ſoul; for they have requited evil unto themſelves.</p>
               <p>Be we exhorted, O Iſrael, to keep and do <hi>all</hi> this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to <hi>love</hi> the Lord our God with all our <hi>heart, ſoul, minde,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength.</hi> Let us not hearken to that objection of unbelieving and lazy men, which hath more of <hi>will</hi> then reaſon in it, that <hi>this Commandement</hi> is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>This opinion hath gotten ground in the mindes of men, partly from the authority of one of the Antients; partly from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred lightleſneſs in the moſt of us; of whom it may be truly ſaid, that <hi>Quae nolumus, difficulter credimus,</hi> thoſe things which we would not, we hardly believe. And as true is that ſaying; <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clives ſumus à labore ad libidinem,</hi> that which is troubleſome or chargeable, we have no heart to believe it. Now becauſe <hi>to love
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:65717:369"/>the Lord our God,</hi> with all our heart, ſoul, mind, and ſtrength, will coſt us all we have, and all we are, we are hardly brought off to think, tis poſſible ever to be performed. Hence it is that they have made this plauſible interpretation of the words, that in them is preſcribed <hi>Non tam quàm currendum, quà quò currendum.</hi> Not ſo much the <hi>way</hi> wherein we ſhould walk, as the <hi>end of our way,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we hope to attain after this life.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and ſuch like ſayings pleaſe us well; becauſe they agree with our lazy diſpoſition. But if the <hi>command</hi> had been reſerved for <hi>another life,</hi> it would not have been preſcribed in <hi>this, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.20. No, nor have been ſaid to be fulfilled in this; as it is ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.8. ſo it is recorded of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.25. That he turned to the Lord <hi>with all his heart, and with all his ſoul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moſes.</hi> Nor would it be ſaid to be the practiſe of the Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.2. Whence we may reaſon thus; If the Saints of God, if <hi>Joſiah,</hi> if <hi>David thus loved</hi> the Lord their God, under the diſpenſation of the <hi>Law,</hi> when the Lord gave a more ſcanty meaſure of his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> how much more is the ſame duly expected of us? <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.8. If they under the <hi>Law,</hi> loved the Lord <hi>with all their ſtrength</hi> when the <hi>Law was weak;</hi> how much more is expected of us under the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> what the Law could not do, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. Now if ever, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Certainly, by how much the more the Spirit and power of God is vouchſafed unto us, by ſo much the more we ſhould perform <hi>this Commandement, to love the Lord with all our heart, ſoul, minde and ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely, if the Lord require obedience unto all <hi>that Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſo as <hi>to love the Lord our God with all theſe,</hi> the Lord allowes no place at all, <hi>no room within us</hi> for any iniquity. He is to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with <hi>all our heart, ſoul, minde, and ſtrength.</hi> And therefore there is not left any place, any degree at all for what is contrary to his love. The Church, which is ſignified by the Kings Daughter, is <hi>all glorious within, Pſal.</hi> 45.13. All that is <hi>within me,</hi> bleſs his holy Name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1. Whoſe cauſe then do they undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, for whom do they plead, for <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Baal,</hi> for <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial,</hi> who ſay, <hi>That ſin muſt remain in us?</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt tells thee, that thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with <hi>all thy heart, &amp;c.</hi> They ſay, <hi>That this cannot be done.</hi> Our Lord ſaith, This <hi>do,</hi> and thou ſhalt live, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.28. And, <hi>this is the love of God, that ye keep his Commandements.</hi> They ſay, <hi>Ye ſhall live,</hi> though ye keep not the Commandements; for its impoſſible to keep them. Juſt ſo the Serpent told <hi>Eve,</hi> Ye ſhall not die: A lie, point-blank contradictory to the God of Truth. They ſay, Chriſt has kept the Commandements <hi>for us,</hi> and <hi>He has loved God with all his heart, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>all</hi> for us. And this is imputed unto us, as if <hi>we our ſelves</hi> had ſo loved the Lord, &amp;c. as if <hi>we our ſelves</hi> had kept all the
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:65717:369"/>Commandements. Their meaning is, Chriſt was <hi>wiſe, juſt, good, humble, loving, meek, ſober, chaſte, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore we may be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, unjuſt, wicked, prowd, hateful, and hating one another, wrathful,</hi> and <hi>impatient,</hi> drunkards, laſcivious, &amp;c. Why? becauſe Chriſt <hi>was wiſe, ſober, &amp;c. all for us.</hi> Grant all this. But hath not Chriſt <hi>ſuffered, leaving as an example, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. and 4.1. <hi>Object.</hi> Hath not Chriſt paid the ranſom and made the atonement? Tis true; Chriſt hath paid the <hi>ranſom</hi> for all; but for whom <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally?</hi> Is it not for theſe who <hi>believe him, love him, walk in all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto him?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10.11. and 5.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.2. A great Prince payes a <hi>Ranſom</hi> for a multitude of <hi>Captives:</hi> Howbeit, thus he indents with them, that they ſhall ever afterward relinquiſh and leave their Priſon, and be Subjects and obedient only unto him. The Lord Jeſus is that great Prince and Saviour, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. He hath paid that <hi>Ranſom for us,</hi> who were <hi>captives</hi> unto Satan, and ſerved <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>iniquity,</hi> And He, upon the like terms, agrees with us, <hi>that we ſhould no more ſerve ſin, Rom.</hi> 6. but that we <hi>being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, ſhould ſerve him in holineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs before him, all the dayes of our life, Luke</hi> 1.74, 75.</p>
               <p>But to come home to their own Aſſertion and ſimilitude; why is not the <hi>love of the Lord our God with all our heart, &amp;c? Via quâ currendum,</hi> but <hi>Scopus</hi> the <hi>mark</hi> whither we muſt run? Its impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſay they, by reaſon of the infirmities of this life, <hi>alwayes actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to think of God, and to be moved in love toward him.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſo to love him,</hi> is not the <hi>way wherein we muſt run.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer. Nor is it neceſſary for him who <hi>loves God and keeps all that Commandement, alwayes actually to think of God, as he is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or to be moved actually with love towards him.</hi> It is enough, if he <hi>alwayes think and do</hi> what is good, juſt and honeſt, and ſo, what is worthy of God. Yea, ſo to <hi>think,</hi> and ſo <hi>to do, is to love God.</hi> For <hi>this is the love of God, that we keep his Commandements,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. And therefore he who is <hi>alwayes buſied</hi> about what is <hi>holy, juſt, and good,</hi> as the Commandement is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. <hi>he loves God with all his heart, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what they ſay, that it is not the <hi>way,</hi> but the <hi>end of the way,</hi> ſurely a <hi>Traveller</hi> who walkes on in the <hi>right way,</hi> it is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that, <hi>every ſtep he takes,</hi> he ſhould <hi>think of</hi> the <hi>end</hi> of his <hi>jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;</hi> but its enough, that he keep on in the <hi>right way</hi> toward his <hi>journeys end.</hi> And therefore holy <hi>David</hi> doubted not to reſolve, <hi>I will run the way of thy Commandements, when thou haſt enlarged my heart.</hi> And he, no doubt, <hi>who does ſo, loves God with all his heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know well, the contrary doctrine is and hath long been taught. But <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it is an holy thing to prefer the truth before all opinions and authorities of men, could <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſay.</p>
               <p>Our Lord and his Apoſtles when they taught the Goſpel, gave
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:65717:370"/>precepts <hi>to be done,</hi> not <hi>in another life, but in this life.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as was intimated before, the Angel commanding the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to preach the Goſpel, calls it, <hi>the words of this life.</hi> And it is very obſervable, when the Lord gives this precept touching the <hi>love of God with all our heart, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 22.37. He doth not cite the words out of <hi>Exodus,</hi> wherein is contained the Law <hi>out of Mount Sinai;</hi> but he quotes them out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. wherein many things are contained, which belong to the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> as it is taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and comes out of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and brings with it ſtrength and power. And ſuch is this in the Text.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſince the nature of <hi>this Commandement,</hi> is ſuch, that, without it, <hi>eternal life cannot be obtained,</hi> ſurely our God would not have preſcribed this precept <hi>to be done in this life,</hi> if it had been to be reſerved for <hi>another life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that <hi>this precept</hi> is of that importance, that, without it, <hi>the eternal life cannot be obtained;</hi> and that, by obſerving it, the <hi>eternal life may be obtained,</hi> appears, by what our Lord ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.25. when the Lawyer asked him, <hi>What ſhall I do, inherit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life?</hi> our Saviour having asked him, what is written in the Law, &amp;c, And the Lawyer returned anſwer, out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c.</hi> Our Saviour then anſwers to this queſtion, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>This do, and thou ſhalt live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Beloved, conſider adviſedly; It concernes every ſoul, which hopes and deſires the <hi>eternal life:</hi> If this be a <hi>neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> for <hi>the obtaining of eternal life,</hi> ſurely, if <hi>eternal life be poſsible to be obtained, it muſt alſo be poſsible to perform the condition,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may <hi>be obtained;</hi> which is, <hi>to love the Lord our God with all our heart, &amp;c.</hi> If otherwiſe the <hi>means</hi> be impoſſible, the <hi>end</hi> alſo muſt be impoſſible whereby that <hi>end</hi> ſhould be obtained; &amp; its all one to ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt not inherit eternal life.</hi> The rule is well known; <hi>Conditio impoſsibilis aequipollet negativae; An impoſsible condition is all one with a negative.</hi> But that we may be the more excited hereunto, ye may be pleaſed to conſider what a <hi>mans heart</hi> is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried unto in this world; what objects, or what in any object, drawes <hi>his love</hi> moſt. For the <hi>heart, ſoul,</hi> and <hi>minde</hi> are ſo ſwayed and carried by <hi>love,</hi> as the body is by the <hi>weight</hi> of it. <hi>Amor meus pondus animae meae,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtin.</hi> And as the <hi>weight</hi> of the body inclines it to the place proper and moſt convenient for it, ſo <hi>love</hi> ſwayes and inclines the whole man to that, which is as it were the proper <hi>place</hi> and <hi>centre</hi> wherein it reſts.</p>
               <p>Now what objects moſt incline the <hi>love</hi> of the natural man? or what moſt of all does the <hi>love</hi> of the natural man incline him unto?</p>
               <p>The Philoſopher long ſince obſerved that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Beauty</hi> or <hi>Comelineſs</hi> moſt takes our fanſie, and wins our heart. And the
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:65717:370"/>Wiſeman confirmes it, when he ſaith, <hi>the man loves nothing better, Eccleſ.</hi> 36.22. Why a man <hi>loves</hi> that which is <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>beautiful,</hi> is a blinde mans queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond object <hi>lovely,</hi> or the <hi>Formale objecti,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>to be loved.</hi> So that if one diſcerned <hi>love</hi> in another, toward him, he muſt be inclined to love him again as naturally, as the ſtone is ſwayed and moved towards the centre. Whence it is a good rule, (and would God we all obſerved it!) <hi>Ut ameris amabilis eſto;</hi> that thou mayeſt be <hi>beloved,</hi> (as every one would be,) be <hi>loving,</hi> amiable, lovely, and courteous; and thou ſhalt win upon his <hi>love</hi> whom thou <hi>loveſt.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Now, Beloved, all theſe are eminently in God as in their root, their ſpring, their centre. 1. All <hi>beauty and comelineſs</hi> it is in him moſt eminently: He is the <hi>faireſt</hi> of ten thouſand. The moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels, who behold the face of God, they cover their own faces and their feet, as conſcious of their own deſormity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Gods <hi>beauty.</hi> From his <hi>beauty,</hi> what ever is <hi>beautiful</hi> in any kinde, receives <hi>its beauty.</hi> And to <hi>love</hi> this moſt <hi>beautiful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> renders him that <hi>loves</hi> it, like unto it; otherwiſe then it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the creatures. For a man <hi>deformed</hi> and <hi>ill favoured, loving</hi> the moſt <hi>beautiful</hi> woman, is not thereby made <hi>beautiful</hi> himſelf, but rather he appears more <hi>deformed.</hi> But he who <hi>loves</hi> the Lord with all his <hi>heart,</hi> &amp;c. He becomes like unto him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>Amor transform at amantem in rem amatam.</hi> Hence it is, that <hi>Moſes</hi> his face ſhined. And they who beheld <hi>Stephen,</hi> ſaw his <hi>face</hi> like the <hi>face</hi> of an Angel.

               <p n="2">2. In regard of man, to whom this Law is given, <hi>this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is firſt;</hi> and that in reſpect 1. Of mans <hi>obligation to act;</hi> and 2.

In regard of the <hi>principle of action,</hi> in the man. For howſoever there be diverſe <hi>principles,</hi> whence the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Commandements, is ſaid to proceed, as <hi>Fear, Faith, Hope,</hi> yet none of them either <hi>ſeverally</hi> or <hi>joyntly</hi> brings forth that obedience to the <hi>Commandements</hi> which God requires, but <hi>love.</hi> For howſoever <hi>faith</hi> be the <hi>fundamental ſaving principle,</hi> yet that works not but by <hi>love, Gal.</hi> 5.6. Which <hi>principle</hi> we finde in the promulgation of the <hi>Law, Exod.</hi> 20.5, 6. And the ſame method our Lord obſerves in the Goſpel, <hi>John</hi> 14.15. If ye <hi>love me, keep my Commandements.</hi> He ſaith not, if ye <hi>fear, believe,</hi> or <hi>truſt in me.</hi> The Apoſtle gives the reaſon of it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. the <hi>end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is charity.</hi> Now if <hi>charity</hi> be the <hi>end,</hi> that is, the <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Commandement,</hi> then is it the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>chief principle,</hi> out of which obedience to the <hi>Commandements,</hi> muſt proceed; <hi>Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens incipit à fine,</hi> a wiſe man <hi>begins from the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, till the man <hi>keep the Commandements</hi> out of this <hi>principle,</hi> he cannot be ſaid to <hi>keep the covenant</hi> of his God; nor God to <hi>keep covenant</hi> with the man. But when the man <hi>loves</hi> his God, and, out of that <hi>love, obeyes</hi> his God, then the Lord <hi>keeps covenant</hi> with him. So <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.4. O Lord the great and dreadful God <hi>keeping the Covenant and mercy towards them that love him, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As this is the <hi>firſt Commandement,</hi> ſo it is alſo called by our Lord the <hi>great Commandement.</hi> And whereas a thing is ſaid to be <hi>great, Quantitate molis,</hi> or, <hi>quantitate virtutis,</hi> in regard of <hi>bulk,</hi> or <hi>power and vertue,</hi> this later way, this <hi>Commandement</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>great,</hi> or, the greateſt, according to <hi>S. Hierom,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>vertue,
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:65717:372"/>power,</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of it; and that both in reſpect of the <hi>ſubject,</hi> and of the <hi>duty</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of the <hi>ſubject;</hi> whoever thus <hi>loves God with all his heart,</hi> his <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>minde</hi> muſt be enabled thereunto by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. It is the <hi>firſt fruit</hi> and ſtrength of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. And the Lord ſo circumciſeth his heart, that he may ſo <hi>love</hi> him with all his <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>with all thy ſoul, and keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements and live, Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.19, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11, 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>duty</hi> it ſelf is moſt required, and beſt accepted by our God. For as <hi>love</hi> is in nature the <hi>firſt</hi> of all the affections, which like the <hi>great wheel</hi> of the Clock, turns about all the reſt. For ſo we <hi>deſire, rejoyce in, fear, hope for, grieve for, &amp;c.</hi> ſome thing which we <hi>love;</hi> ſuch is the <hi>divine love</hi> to <hi>all other graces. The Spirit of God in this great wheel</hi> actuates and moves all the other <hi>graces.</hi> Yea, and this <hi>divine love</hi> ſwallowes up all other inferiour affections, all other <hi>love, concupiſcence,</hi> and <hi>deſire.</hi> As the Serpent of <hi>Moſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured all the Serpents of the Egyptian Magicians. For he who <hi>loves God with all his heart, and keeps all this Commandement,</hi> he can <hi>love</hi> nothing repugnant unto God, nothing but in order unto God; he <hi>loves</hi> himſelf only in order unto God, and for God. He <hi>loves</hi> his neighbour out of his <hi>love</hi> of God, even as he <hi>loves himſelf,</hi> that is, in <hi>order unto God.</hi> So he <hi>loves</hi> his neighbour, that he is of <hi>one heart,</hi> and <hi>one ſoul</hi> with his neighbour, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32. So that his <hi>love</hi> of his <hi>neighbour,</hi> and of <hi>himſelf,</hi> are no way contrary to the <hi>intire love of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, howſoever many other duties are enjoyned us, beſide this Commandement, yet this of all the reſt is the <hi>greateſt,</hi> and moſt excellent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.</hi> and that for two reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its moſt <hi>durable,</hi> and outlaſts all the reſt; and therefore its preferred before <hi>Propheſie, Tongues, Knowledge;</hi> yea, before <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> it ſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>love</hi> of God is the <hi>Seiſin,</hi> and the <hi>common ingredient</hi> of all the Chriſtian mans actions; that pretious tincture that turns all, it touches, into gold, as, they ſay, <hi>Midas</hi> did. And what ever wants this divine <hi>tincture of holy love,</hi> tis like the <hi>Terra damnata,</hi> tis nothing worth.</p>
               <p>Hence the Apoſtles general adviſe is; <hi>Let all your things be done in charity,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.14. A rule ſo neceſſary, that the very <hi>beſt and greateſt duties</hi> otherwiſe performed, whether towards God, or towards our neighbour, are of no value, in the ſight of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>I ſhall adde no more <hi>motives.</hi> Let us rather come to diſcover our <hi>love</hi> to the Lord our God, whether we keep <hi>this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>love</hi> of God proceeds from a <hi>pure heart,</hi> a <hi>good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and <hi>faith unfeigned,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. How then canſt thou <hi>love</hi> thy
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:65717:372"/>God, when thou ſayeſt, thy <hi>heart cannot be pure?</hi> And how can thy <hi>faith be unfeigned,</hi> when thou believeſt not, that thou art able to <hi>love the Lord thy God with all thy heart?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Love will ſuffer nothing to intervene, or ſeparate us from the party we <hi>love,</hi> that may hinder our <hi>union. Love knits, unites,</hi> and <hi>makes one,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that which is <hi>continued, is one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>love unto God unites us,</hi> and makes us <hi>one with him,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Saviours prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17.21. and that of the Apoſtle, he who is joyned unto the Lord, is <hi>one Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. Such <hi>love</hi> of our God, will not endure any <hi>mixture of what is contrary</hi> to our God. And therefore <hi>S. Paul</hi> having exhorted to <hi>ſincerity of love,</hi> which is required even in the loweſt degree of it, as hath been ſhewen; Let <hi>love be without diſsimulation, Rom.</hi> 12.9. he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently adds, <hi>Abhor that which is evil. Sincerity of love</hi> unto our God, will not endure any <hi>corrival,</hi> any <hi>thing</hi> or <hi>perſon,</hi> to ſhare with our God in <hi>our love</hi> of him.</p>
               <p>How then canſt thou ſay, thou <hi>loveſt</hi> the Lord thy God with <hi>all thy heart</hi> and <hi>all thy ſoul,</hi> and <hi>keepeſt all that Commandement,</hi> when yet thou knoweſt, that thou <hi>lovest thy pleaſures more then thou loveſt thy God?</hi> when thou knoweſt, thou <hi>loveſt the world</hi> and the <hi>things of this world?</hi> Ye Adulterers and Adultereſſes! Know ye not, that the <hi>friendſhip of the world is the enmity of God? Jam.</hi> 4.4. So the Greek text hath it; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore will be a <hi>friend</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> is made an <hi>enemy of God.</hi> Wouldſt thou believe thy wife, ſhould ſhe ſay, ſhe <hi>loved</hi> thee, whileſt ſhe proſtitutes her ſelf unto another man? And wilt thou pretend to be the <hi>loving Spouſe</hi> of thy <hi>Maker,</hi> yet <hi>love his enemy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>love</hi> of God puts us upon ſuch works as he <hi>loves.</hi> Whence the Apoſtle, This, ſaith he, is the love of God, that we keep his Commandements. It puts us upon the <hi>love of our neighbour; Love</hi> works no evil to his <hi>neighbour, Rom.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Ad populum Phaleras</hi>—Away with all trappings and falſe pretences of <hi>love,</hi> without the reality of it!</p>
               <p>Good <hi>diſcourſe</hi> and <hi>holy conference</hi> proceeding from a life wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, and a <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> which <hi>loves God,</hi> is an <hi>edge</hi> which pierceth to the <hi>aſsimilating</hi> of others unto it ſelf. Such a <hi>ſoul edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,</hi> and conveighs grace to the hearers: For <hi>charity edifies,</hi> not <hi>knowledge,</hi> not <hi>holy talk</hi> without it. The Phariſees of old <hi>knew</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much of God and his Word, and wayes, and ſpake very much of God. And they of all others, moſt reaſoned with our Lord, concerning God and his truth. But our Lord tells them, I know, that ye have not the <hi>love of God in you, John</hi> 5.42. And we may ſay the like of the Phariſees of our time; They are great <hi>talkers of God, and of Religion;</hi> and indeed would ſeem to be the onely people of God, and to <hi>know all things knowable.</hi> They are indeed
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:65717:373"/>the true <hi>Amorites;</hi> great <hi>Talkers and moſt bitter men</hi> in their inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives againſt all, who are not of their opinion, (as no wiſe man is;) And therefore we may know, that they have not the <hi>love</hi> of God in them. They have a <hi>knowing knowledge,</hi> or ſuch as reflects upon it ſelf, as the Apoſtle ſaith, we <hi>know,</hi> that we all have <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> This <hi>knowledge puffs men up</hi> and makes them proud; but <hi>charity edifies,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1.2.

               <p>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt deals ſo with his brethren, (He is not aſhamed to call us ſo, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.11.)

               <p>Yea, in the fallen <hi>Ox</hi> and <hi>Aſſe</hi> there is a principle of life and power toward the <hi>raiſing of it ſelf.</hi> And how much better prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is there in the fallen <hi>believing man</hi> toward the <hi>raiſing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> to a more eminent life?

               <p>There is remaining in the <hi>grain</hi> of Wheat now dead, an <hi>active principle</hi> of life, the <hi>Balſamum naturale,</hi> the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>radical bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> which <hi>recals</hi> and <hi>raiſeth up</hi> the plant to <hi>life,</hi> and multiplyes it, <hi>John</hi> 12.24.</p>
               <p>But, that this may be done, the Lord calls upon us to <hi>plough up our fallow grounds,</hi> to <hi>mortifie our earthly members.</hi> To <hi>die daily unto ſin;</hi> for that's implyed in the next words, he that <hi>loves his life, ſhall loſe it, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>But ſurely the <hi>grace</hi> of God does not work with <hi>violence;</hi> but gently and ſweetly, according to the <hi>fabrick</hi> of mans heart, which God the maker of it, beſt knowes; and accordingly <hi>drawes men with the cords of a man, even with loving kindneſs, Hoſ.</hi> 11.4.</p>
               <p>And therefore when this <hi>grace</hi> is withſtood and reſiſted, the Lord complains, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.27. O <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> how often <hi>would</hi> I, and ye <hi>would not? &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 7.

               <p>Theſe, and many like Scriptures there are, wherein the Spirit of God <hi>complains,</hi> that men <hi>reſiſt the grace</hi> of God, &amp; yield not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereunto.

<pb n="721" facs="tcp:65717:375"/>and after this <hi>compulſion,</hi> the <hi>only wiſe God</hi> ſhall reward them with everlaſting bliſs and ſalvation. But does not the Apoſtle bid us <hi>to hope</hi> perfectly for the <hi>grace</hi> that ſhall come unto us at the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Jeſus Chriſt?

               <p>The <hi>grace</hi> of God to the <hi>fallen man,</hi> ſuppoſeth a <hi>power</hi> in him to <hi>receive it,</hi> and ſo to <hi>comply with it,</hi> that he <hi>receive it not in vain,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1.

               <p>The miſ-tranſlation in theſe words could not ſo well be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, without the expreſſion, and ſetting down of the whole Paragraph. Which howſoever it be broken into four verſes, yet is it, in the whole, no more then one <hi>connex Axiom,</hi> or <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional propoſition,</hi> as will appear, if we ſhall firſt underſtand, that, it is not generally true, though many conceive it to be ſo, that our Lord, in his moſt divine <hi>Sermon on the Mount,</hi> intended only the <hi>confutation</hi> of the Phariſees <hi>falſe gloſſes,</hi> and <hi>miſ-interpretations</hi> of <hi>Gods Law:</hi> For it is evident, that both the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Mat.</hi> 5. v. 21.—30. are no other then the very <hi>Law</hi> of God, in the ſixth and ſeventh Commandements. And our Lords expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them, have no way <hi>confuted</hi> them; but only added their <hi>inward and ſpiritual meanings</hi> thereunto. That, whereas the <hi>Lawes</hi> againſt <hi>murder and adultery,</hi> in the letter, were underſtood onely to reſtrain the <hi>outward act;</hi> our Lord ſhewes, that theſe <hi>Lawes</hi> reach even to the <hi>heart</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it could not be his general <hi>ſcope:</hi> Howbeit in that Sermon, I deny not, but he meets with <hi>falſe gloſſes and miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Gods Law.</hi> And ſuch was this cuſtome and practice of the Jewes divorcement, which we have now before us; which they grounded upon theſe four verſes ſo rendred, as our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have turnd them. And indeed that Tranſlation confirmes their practice.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> will hardly afford any ſuch ſenſe, as they gather from them, to warrant them to <hi>put away their wives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe words ver. 1. ſo turnd, [<hi>Then let him write her a bill of divorcement,</hi> (or, cutting off) <hi>and ſend her away out of his houſe.</hi>] Theſe words do not neceſſarily bear any ſuch conſtruction: yet hence they collected, that, for many cauſes, a man might <hi>put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if theſe four firſt verſes be well lookt into, and the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers

                  <hi>ſcope</hi> conſidered, we ſhall finde, that theſe verſes make up one intire ſentence; and that the three firſt of thoſe verſes, are but only the <hi>Antecedent</hi> of a <hi>Connex Axiom;</hi> and the fourth verſe the <hi>Conſequent,</hi> and that which makes the ſentence full.</p>
               <p>For whereas ver. 1. the Tranſlators render the words <hi>Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> by way of <hi>precept, Then let him write her a bill of divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the very ſame words meet us again ver. 3. which yet they turn not <hi>Imperatively,</hi> as before; nor indeed are they ſo to be rendred; and therefore neither the <hi>former:</hi> ſince they are both in the very ſame <hi>tenſe;</hi> and all thoſe three verſes are but <hi>Sententia pendula,</hi> as it is called, an imperfect ſentence depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſomewhat following, and which is <hi>compleated</hi> and <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> by the fourth verſe, thus.</p>
               <p>If (or, when) a man hath <hi>taken a wife</hi> and married her; and it come to paſs, that ſhe finde no favour in his eyes, becauſe, &amp;c. and <hi>(if)</hi> he write her a <hi>bill of divorcement, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>(if)</hi> ſhe go, and be another mans: and if the later husband hate her, &amp;c. or, if the later husband die, &amp;c. (all which are parts of the <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;</hi> then) her former husband, who ſent her away, may not take her again to be his <hi>wife, &amp;c.</hi> So that all the three firſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are but a <hi>condition</hi> of the <hi>Antecedent</hi> in order to the <hi>conſequent;</hi> a <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> of ſomewhat which poſſibly might be; and if it ſo come to paſs, then the <hi>conſequent</hi> will take place.

               <p>And thus the Greek Interpreters expreſs the ſenſe of theſe four verſes. And the vulg. Latin, yea, and the Chald. Paraph. may be ſo underſtood: And ſo <hi>Tremellius</hi> renders the words; and ſo <hi>Vatablus</hi> explains them: <hi>Scripſerit<expan>

               <p>And that this is the main <hi>ſcope of this Law,</hi> That the former <hi>husband</hi> may not take his <hi>wife</hi> again, which hath been the wife of another man, its clear by the Prophet <hi>Jeremies</hi> reference unto this very text, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. They ſay, (or ſaying) if a man <hi>put away his wife,</hi> and ſhe go from him, and become <hi>another mans,</hi> ſhall he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto her again? ſhall not the land be greatly polluted? where we read no <hi>command,</hi> that a man ſhould <hi>put away his wife.</hi> But only that a man having <hi>put away his wife,</hi> and ſhe become <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans,</hi> he muſt not receive her again. Only from ſuppoſition, that a man having <hi>put away his wife,</hi> and given her a <hi>bill of divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> hence they collected, that a man might <hi>put away his wife.</hi> How witty men are in miſconſtruing the <hi>Law</hi> of God, to make it ſuit with their own <hi>corrupt wills?</hi>

They have found out many inventions, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi> For whereas the outward idolatry ſeemed to be too groſs and palpable to deceive the world any longer, Satan obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon men an inward kinde of idolatry more ſubtil and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For after the <hi>Synagoga magna</hi> had quite diſcountenanced out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Idols, calling <hi>Baal Boſheth, Bethel Bethaven, Beelzebub Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebul, &amp;c.</hi> Inſtead of theſe, the Elders of the Jews choſe other Images, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.1.—7. And ſuch as theſe are many Idols of later time; which men of ſeveral opinions, <hi>imagine</hi> and <hi>engrave,</hi> and ſet up above all the reſt to be adored. As among the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, <hi>Aliquid magni eſt in unaquaque Secta,</hi> ſaith <hi>Mirandula,</hi> ſome great thing there is in every Sect; ſo among Chriſtians; to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle out ſome tenent or other and cry up <hi>that;</hi> and if <hi>that</hi> can but be in credit, it matters not what becomes of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo zealous men are for the <hi>worſhip,</hi> every man of his own <hi>Idol,</hi> that every one drawes another to the <hi>worſhip</hi> of it; and if that cannot be obtained, then the bond of <hi>charity</hi> muſt be broken. Yea, if ſuch <hi>Idol-makers</hi> get power into their hands, they <hi>force</hi> others to the <hi>worſhip of their Idols,</hi> even with fear of death; like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Dan.</hi> 3.6.

<pb n="741" facs="tcp:65717:385"/>of this, and many of them have experienced the truth of it, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. The time cometh, that whoſoever <hi>killeth you,</hi> he ſhall think, that he <hi>offereth a gift</hi> unto God. The Syriac Interpreter hath <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="5">5. It is poſſible, that Gods people may be ſo <hi>driven away,</hi> that they may <hi>worſhip and ſerve other gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth of this appears in the words before us; as alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.19. leſt thou lift up thine eyes to the <hi>heavens,</hi> and, when thou ſeeſt the Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars, <hi>the whole hoſt of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi>

                  </gap> and thou be <hi>driven</hi> (ſo our Tranſlators turn the word there) to <hi>worſhip</hi> them and <hi>ſerve</hi> them, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why tis poſſible, that the people of God, may be <hi>driven to worſhip and ſerve other gods,</hi> may appear from the danger of the <hi>other gods;</hi> To <hi>have them,</hi> endangers the <hi>worſhip</hi> of them. So the Lord having prohibited <hi>other gods, Exod.</hi> 20.3. and <hi>making Idols,</hi> adds, thou ſhalt not <hi>bow down</hi> thy ſelf to them nor <hi>ſerve them. Ducit enim &amp; affectu quodam infirmo rapit infirma corda mortalium formae ſimilitudo, &amp;c.</hi> For the <hi>likeneſs of form</hi> wins upon the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and takes the <hi>weak hearts</hi> of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beſide, there is a proneneſs, by corrupt nature to <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition;</hi> as appears by the frequent <hi>prohibitions</hi> of it, and by that <hi>care</hi> and <hi>providence</hi> of God towards man, in that he hath revealed no <hi>bodily image</hi> of himſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>But how can it be true, that the people of God ſhould be <hi>dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away</hi> from him, and <hi>ſo worſhip other gods?</hi> 1. God will not. 2. The Devil cannot.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God will not. It ſuits neither with his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> nor with his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that he ſhould drive men to that, from which, by ſo many Motives and Arguments, in his Word, he <hi>withdrawes them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Devil cannot <hi>drive</hi> a believer to <hi>worſhip other gods:</hi> but on the contrary, a believer may <hi>reſiſt</hi> and <hi>drive</hi> away the Devil. Reſiſt the Devil, and he will fly from you.</p>
               <p>Whence then is it, that the people of God, are <hi>driven</hi> to <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſerve other gods?</hi> Whence, but from the <hi>drift and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of their own <hi>perverſe will?</hi> So <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Piſcator,</hi> If thou <hi>letteſt thy ſelf be driven, &amp;c.</hi> Accordingly the Apoſtles phraſe is; <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="742" facs="tcp:65717:386"/>
               <p>Hence it appears, that the man is <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>They who affirm this or the like Poſitions, they are accounted <hi>Free-willers,</hi> as if this were the name of ſome <hi>old Sect</hi> or <hi>Hereſie.</hi> Whereas indeed to <hi>will</hi> or <hi>nill</hi> the ſame thing, or, to <hi>will</hi> or <hi>nill</hi> the contrary, is as natural to a <hi>man</hi> as any other property he has.

                  </gap> a <hi>perverſe generation.</hi> But although the words have like ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of <hi>wreſting, writhing, depraving,</hi> yet ſhould not the Tranſlators have <hi>inverted</hi> and <hi>perverted</hi> the genuine order of the words, as they have done, (unleſs thereby they intended an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy) turning them <hi>perverſe and crooked,</hi> inſtead of <hi>crooked and perverſe</hi> generation; which errour they corrected, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15.

                  </gap>, which our Tranſlators render in the midſt of a <hi>crooked and perverſe nation, or rather generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two former <hi>characters</hi> of this wicked people, do not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily imply a ſpreading beyond themſelves; He <hi>corrupted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> not another: ſo the Chald.

But when this people are called a <hi>crooked and perverſe generation,</hi> the Hebrew words import craft and ſubtilty to <hi>circumvent</hi> and deceive others; ſo <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.9. They
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:65717:392"/>make crooked what is ſtraight, which elegant oppoſition is loſt in our Tranſlation.

Privations</hi> are known by their <hi>habits,</hi> and <hi>deprivations</hi> by their <hi>integrity</hi> and <hi>ſoundneſs.</hi> That therefore we may know, what's meant by <hi>crooked,</hi> we muſt know what is <hi>ſtraight,</hi> becauſe, <hi>Rectum eſt judex ſui &amp; obliqui;</hi> what is <hi>ſtraight,</hi> diſcovers it ſelf, and what is <hi>crooked.</hi> That's <hi>ſtraight</hi> and <hi>right</hi> which inclines to neither part; as a <hi>ſtraight</hi> line lies even between two termes: as a <hi>straight</hi> way inclines neither to the <hi>right</hi> hand nor to the <hi>left;</hi> as we read it deſcribed by <hi>Moſes, Num.</hi> 20.17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.27. The rule of this <hi>Rectitude</hi> is the word of God, which is <hi>Right, Pſal.</hi> 19.8. and 33.4. And his word is conformable to himſelf who is <hi>right, Deut.</hi> 32.4.

               <p>Hence we may underſtand what is <hi>obliquety</hi> and <hi>crookedneſs,</hi> namely, an <hi>averſion</hi> and <hi>deflexion,</hi> from that original <hi>ſtraightneſs rectitude</hi> and <hi>uprightneſs</hi> in our God.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>crookedneſs</hi> is framed by a rule, which is <hi>iniquity, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs</hi> and <hi>irregularity.</hi> For as <hi>rectitude</hi> and <hi>uprightneſs</hi> is compared to a <hi>ſtraight way;</hi> ſo is <hi>iniquity,</hi> to <hi>by-wayes, crooked</hi> and <hi>erroneous</hi> wayes: So <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and <hi>Pecco,</hi> to <hi>ſin.</hi> And as <hi>rectitude,</hi> and the rule of it, is <hi>conformity</hi> unto the <hi>upright</hi> God himſelf, ſo <hi>crookedneſs</hi> and <hi>irregularity</hi> the rule of it, is <hi>conformity</hi> to the Devill himſelf, the <hi>crooked Serpent, Eſay,</hi> 27.1. And as the <hi>upright</hi> God made the man <hi>upright</hi> in his generation, and according to his will; So the Divill the <hi>crooked</hi> Serpent <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuded</hi> man and brought him to the <hi>bent</hi> of his will, in the <hi>degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> God made man <hi>upright;</hi> but they have found out many inventions, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29.</p>
               <p>Whence appears the reaſon why this <hi>generation</hi> became <hi>crooked</hi> and <hi>perverſe.</hi> For although the <hi>heart</hi> it ſelf <hi>perverts</hi> it ſelf, (as hath been ſhewen on <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.17.) yet this comes not to paſs without a <hi>Tempter declining</hi> and <hi>bending</hi> the man to his will.</p>

It is given them for this end, to work in them; as <hi>Solomon</hi> prayed, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.9. <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 9.10.

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. Note here that a man who is <hi>wiſe, by the wiſdom of God,</hi> hath that <hi>wiſdom in him.</hi> For nothing can render another like it ſelf, but it muſt be <hi>in him</hi> in whom it works. Since therefore Chriſt is the true <hi>wiſdom,</hi> he muſt <hi>be in thoſe</hi> whom he makes <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthens by his wiſdom,</hi> and will be found of all that ſeek him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. A great diverſity, and a broad difference between <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fear,</hi> and the <hi>fear of God,</hi> which the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> here calls <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Humane fear</hi> abates mens courage; <hi>Timor minuit;</hi> Fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes thoſe ſuccours which reaſon would afford, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 17.12. But the <hi>fear of God,</hi> which, is the <hi>wiſdom</hi> here meant, <hi>encourages and ſtrengthens the wiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. Hence it followes, that <hi>a wiſe man is a valiant man.</hi> The <hi>Wiſeman</hi> tells us ſo much expreſly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.5. <hi>A wiſe man is ſtrong, yea, a man of knowledge encreaſeth ſtrength. Solomon</hi> knew this from his father <hi>Davids</hi> example, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1. Such a valiant man was <hi>S. Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.35. &amp;c. who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation or diſtreſs, &amp;c. In all theſe things we are more then Conquerours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That as there are diverſe ſorts of <hi>wiſdom,</hi> divine, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and diabolical, as hath been ſhewen; ſo the <hi>divine wiſdom</hi> it ſelf, hath diverſe degrees. And the wiſdom here ſpoken of, is the loweſt: For <hi>Solomon</hi> having ſpoken of the <hi>fear of God,</hi> which is the <hi>beginning of wiſdom,</hi> he preſently ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>This wiſdom,</hi> namely, the <hi>fear of God, ſtrengtheneth the wiſe.</hi> He implyes, that there is another, and higher degree <hi>of wiſdom</hi> then this is: of which <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaks experimentally, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26, 27, 28, 29. the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, which is Chriſt in you, &amp;c. whereunto I alſo labour, ſtriving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his working which worketh in me mightily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. This reſolves a great doubt, which might be made, by comparing the ſpeech of the Wiſeman, <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 24.21. where the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſaith, They that <hi>eat</hi> me, ſhall yet be <hi>hungry,</hi> and they that <hi>drink</hi> me, ſhall yet be <hi>thirſty:</hi> Whereas <hi>John</hi> 4.14. Whoſoever, ſaith the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God, <hi>drinketh</hi> of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall <hi>never thirſt, &amp;c.</hi> And 6.35. He that cometh to me,
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:65717:397"/>ſhall never <hi>hunger, &amp;c.</hi> Whence its evident, the former words are to be underſtood of the former and lower degree of <hi>wiſdom;</hi> and the later of the conſummate and perfect wiſdom, called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>wiſdoms,</hi> able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. The wiſdom of the juſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17.</p>
               <p>Which juſtly reproves our great unthankfulneſs unto the Lord Jeſus our Saviour and Deliverer, who ſaves and delivers us out of the hands of our enemies; who redeems us from iniquity, from the curſe of the Law, from the wrath of God, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.10. from eternal death, from him who hath the power of death, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. Yet who returns thanks? <hi>Solomon</hi> tels us a Story, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.14. of a little City delivered by a poor wiſe man. And what is this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle City but the Church profeſſing godlineſs? <hi>S. Matth.</hi> 5.14. Such indeed are but few in regard of the whole world. Againſt this little City comes a great King, the Prince of this World. He <hi>beſieges it, he goes about</hi> ſeeking whom he may devour. This is the true <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> he who <hi>ſtraightneth and beſiegeth judgement;</hi> the <hi>wicked compaſsing about the righteous, &amp;c. Habac.</hi> 1. v. 2, 3, 4. w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> cauſeth <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to mourn &amp; make lamentation. He is wont, ſaith one of the pious Antients, to be a type of the Devil. This <hi>King of all the children of pride, Job</hi> 41.34. This Prince of this World, ſets all the World againſt this <hi>little City.</hi> All that is in this <hi>World,</hi> the luſts of the fleſh, &amp;c. all temptations unto ſin; all occaſions of ſin, &amp;c. He ſummons his Servants, all <hi>Tyrants, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> the <hi>Wiſemen,</hi> and <hi>wiſdom of the world,</hi> and the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>fleſh.</hi> Ye read of ſuch a <hi>ſtraight ſiege, Revel.</hi> 20.8. when the <hi>City</hi> is ſo little and ſo few to defend it, it ſeems it might eaſily be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. How much more when the Prince of this World comes and <hi>begirts</hi> it with all the power of this World? This City, the poor Wiſeman, who for our ſakes became poor, delivers, yet who remembers this poor Wiſeman?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Axiom</hi> 2. <hi>Wiſdom ſtrengthens the wiſe, more then ten mighty men who are in the City.</hi> Theſe words of the Wiſeman preſent us with the piraſe of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> compared with <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> For ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> here uſed ſignifies one that's <hi>ſtrong and powerful;</hi> whence the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> call their Governours <hi>Soldans</hi> or <hi>Sultans,</hi> that is, <hi>men of power and authority, mighty men.</hi> Whereas the <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> is compared with <hi>ten ſuch Princes or mighty men,</hi> and preferred before them. The number of Ten is not here exactly and preciſely of neceſſity to be underſtood, but as we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in common ſpeech, uſe a <hi>definite</hi> number for an <hi>indefinite;</hi> as <hi>Caſtellio</hi> here, <hi>Decies tantum, ten times as much,</hi> that is, <hi>many times.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe, the number Ten is the boundary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which we number not, but by <hi>repeating.</hi> Hence it is that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that ſignifies <hi>Ten,</hi> is from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to <hi>contain;</hi> becauſe it <hi>comprehends</hi> all numbers. The Scripture ſpeaks thus, <hi>Job</hi> 19.3.
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:65717:397"/>Theſe ten times have ye reproached me; that is, <hi>oftentimes.</hi> And ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> complains that <hi>Laban</hi> had changed his wages ten times, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.7. And the Lord, ſaith he, was tempted ſo often by his people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.22. Thus <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.1. ye read of <hi>Ten</hi> inſtead of the whole number of the Church: and diverſe the like.</p>
               <p>The truth of this is evident, both by teſtimony of natural expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and Scripture. 1. Experience; as the Heathen found it true, who ſaid, <hi>Cedant arma togae,</hi>—Arms muſt yield to the Gown. And <hi>Archimedes</hi> the Mathematitian was more feared by the <hi>Romans</hi> then all the power of <hi>Syracuſe:</hi> Inſomuch, as if the Souldiers beſieging the City, ſaw but a Line, or a ſmall piece of wood hanging down the wall, they preſently ſuſpected ſome Engine, and would cry out, <hi>Archimedes, Archimedes,</hi> and turn their backs and flye; which they diſdained to do, at all the ſtrength of the <hi>Souldiery.</hi> But the Scripture proves this expreſly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.22. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.17. and 9.14. And the <hi>weaker</hi> Sex arm'd with <hi>wiſdom</hi> prevail'd againſt the <hi>ſtrong;</hi> witneſs <hi>Debora, Jahel,</hi> and the wiſe Woman of <hi>Abel,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why <hi>this wiſdom ſo ſtrengthens the wiſe,</hi> even more then many mighty men, ſo that <hi>one wiſe man</hi> more preſerves the City then <hi>many ſtrong men;</hi> it ſeems to be, becauſe, <hi>Wiſdom</hi> both <hi>originally</hi> and <hi>formally,</hi> is concrete with <hi>power and might:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever <hi>ſtrength</hi> can do alone, that alſo can <hi>Wiſdom</hi> do &amp; more. Therefore <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is deſcribed the <hi>breath of the power of God,</hi> and a pure efflux from the glory of the Almighty, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 7.25.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wiſ.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 25.</note> And <hi>formally</hi> the ſame Chriſt is the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God, and the <hi>power</hi> of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. which is the ſecond neceſſary for our ſpiritual war.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſides, there is a priority in nature: For <hi>Vis conſilii expers mole ruit ſuâ;</hi> Force without Counſel, periſheth by his own weight. And therefore if <hi>ſtrength</hi> be ſucceſsful and proſperous in the actions of it, it muſt preſuppoſe <hi>Wiſdom</hi> as the <hi>guide</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of it. Yea, <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is the <hi>Teacher of Valour;</hi> yea, of <hi>Prudence, Temperance,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> according to <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 8.7. If a man love <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> her labours are vertues; For ſhe teacheth <hi>Temperance, Prudence, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Fortitude,</hi> which are ſuch things that men can have nothing more profitable in their life, which are the four Cardinall Vertues known and famous among the wiſe <hi>Heathen.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. If that <hi>wiſdom</hi> which is the <hi>fear of God,</hi> and but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <hi>of wiſdom,</hi> as its often called, be yet <hi>ſtronger then many mighty men,</hi> how much more ſtrong is the progreſs and increaſe of divine <hi>wiſdom in faith which overcomes the world?</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. Yea, how much more <hi>ſtrong</hi> is that mighty <hi>power of love</hi> which is <hi>God himſelf?</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.8.16. The laſt enemy that ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:65717:398"/>is Death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. And <hi>love</hi> is <hi>ſtrong</hi> as <hi>death it ſelf, Cant.</hi> 8.6.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The <hi>divine wiſdom</hi> is of more <hi>power</hi> and <hi>force</hi> then all <hi>humane wiſdom and ſtrength.</hi> This appears by the examples of holy men, not trained up in Trades, Arts, and Sciences, yet able to judge of them even better then they who profeſſed them. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> no States-man, <hi>Paul</hi> no Mariner, yet able to out-vie them, to out-ſhoot them in their own Bow. The like we may truly ſay of the <hi>divine wiſdom</hi> in regard of all <hi>humane power and might.</hi> What is the moſt glorious pretence of uſing <hi>might and power?</hi> Is it not the <hi>cauſe of Religion?</hi> the building up and defence of pure religion? Does not the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> tell us here, that <hi>wiſdom ſtrengthens</hi> the <hi>wiſe</hi> more then <hi>ten mighty men</hi> that are in the City? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what ye read, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.6. ſpoken of the material Temple, the building of it, not by <hi>might</hi> nor by <hi>power;</hi> and the ſame is moſt true if underſtood of the <hi>ſpiritual Temple</hi> the <hi>Church of God.</hi> All the Zelots in all Ages they have found that by their <hi>tyranny,</hi> all that could be effected, was but to make many Hypocrites like themſelves: But to <hi>build up the Church of God</hi> of <hi>living ſtones,</hi> it is the work of <hi>divine wiſdom</hi> which reaches from end to end <hi>ſtrongly,</hi> and diſpoſes all things ſweetly, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 8.8. And therefore when the Lord appeared to <hi>Eliah,</hi> now zealous of Gods glory, who might ſeem to pray for fire from Heaven, to deſtroy <hi>Jezabel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.11. The Lord was neither in the <hi>ſtrong winde,</hi> nor <hi>earthquake,</hi> nor <hi>fire,</hi> but in a ſtill voice. And let them take notice of this, who like <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> even out of <hi>zeal</hi> for God and Chriſt, wiſh for <hi>fire</hi> from Heaven to conſume their ſuppoſed enemies, the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God tells them, <hi>They know not of what ſpirit they are, Luke</hi> 9.55.</p>

                  <hi>Myſticè.</hi> The <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God, which is Chriſt, is more <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and more helpful to us then <hi>ten,</hi> then many Princes, then all the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>men and Angels.</hi> When all the <hi>guardian Angels</hi> ſay, We have healed <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſhe was not healed, &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.9. then deſcends the <hi>great Phyſitian of ſouls</hi> into the Church which is in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſaith <hi>S.

And therefore he is called <hi>Jaſhobeam,</hi> who <hi>dwells in the people,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.11. He <hi>dwels in us except we be caſtawayes.</hi> And there he <hi>ſubdues all the power of the enemy.</hi> Would we then obtaine this <hi>wiſdom?</hi> It is neer us in our mouth and in our heart. It is <hi>in us:</hi> for nothing can render us like unto it ſelf but it muſt be <hi>in us;</hi> as was ſhewen before.</p>
               <p>This ſpeakes ſtrong conſolation to the ſimple ſoul, <hi>wiſe</hi> and yet but <hi>weak,</hi> and ambitious of an higher and more eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>divine wiſdom:</hi> In which caſe, <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1.

So muſt the <hi>ſpirituall ages</hi> have their times and ſucceſſions alſo: For as the viſible Sun by few or many and often revolutions makes a like number of dayes in the outward world: So doth the <hi>Sun of righteouſnes</hi> by few or many reuolutions on the ſouls of thoſe who <hi>feare God,</hi> make ſome children of a few dayes, ſome youngmen of more, ſome oldmen and full of dayes; and ſo <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> enters into the holy ſouls according to the <hi>ages, Wiſd.</hi> 7.27.

               <p>That thus the words are to be rendred of a Juſt man <hi>in statu inconſiſtente,</hi> in an inconſiſtent and changeable eſtate; it is clear from <hi>Solomons</hi> main <hi>ſcope,</hi> he aims at in this book; and from the <hi>context</hi> of the 20 verſe with v. 19. 1. That <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch a Juſt man as is under the <hi>firſt diſpenſation, that of the Father,</hi> which is the <hi>fear of God;</hi> a mutable and imperfect eſtate, will appear to you, if ye ſhall be pleaſed to conſider, that, whereas the Wiſemans <hi>intent</hi> in this book, is, to diſcover the <hi>bliſs</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> of man, anſwerable to <hi>that diſpenſation</hi> under which, he himſelf and that generation lived, he proceeds firſt <hi>negatively</hi> by removing the vain opinion of many, who place their true <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> ſome in <hi>Knowledge,</hi> others in <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> others in <hi>Honour,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>Wealth.</hi> All theſe rejected; 2. He proceeds <hi>poſitively,</hi> affirming, that the <hi>chief good, bliſs, and happineſs</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>fear of God,</hi> Chap. 12.13. with which aſſertion he concludes this book. Thus <hi>Job</hi> 28.28. Now although this be true, yet this is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained unto the <hi>firſt diſpenſation,</hi> which is <hi>inchoative wiſdom</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> as it appeareth by the deſcription of it, where its ſaid to be the <hi>beginning of wiſdom.</hi> For there is no doubt but the <hi>righteouſneſs of faith</hi> far tranſcends that of <hi>fear,</hi> as we ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This appears alſo from the context of this Verſe with the former: This <hi>Wiſdom</hi> which is that <hi>fear of God,</hi> ſtrengthens the <hi>wiſe, &amp;c. Though</hi> there be not a Juſt man upon earth that doth good and <hi>may not ſin.</hi>

               <p>This <hi>obſcurity</hi> is much encreaſed by <hi>miſtakes</hi> and <hi>overſights</hi> in tranſlation; as alſo by impoſing upon the Scriptures, <hi>falſe gloſſes</hi> and <hi>miſ-interpretations,</hi> as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> ſtopt the Wells, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. ſo that men cannot, as otherwiſe they might, with joy, draw wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, out of the Wells of Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The difficulty may proceed from ſome <hi>defect in us,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet <hi>unconverted</hi> and <hi>averſe from God,</hi> and his wayes, according to that of <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.13. <hi>We have not turned from our iniquities, that we might underſtand the truth.</hi> And therefore <hi>S.

And for this purpoſe, it is a good <hi>old</hi> prayer; I know no <hi>new</hi> one bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and it may be ours, for advance of our preſent buſineſs; <hi>Lighten our darkneſs, we beſeech thee O Lord!</hi> The Text in the Greek

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which our Tranſlators render, as I have ſhowen; how truly, we ſhall then underſtand, when we finde, how unſuitable this Tranſlation is to the will of God revealed in his Word.</p>
               <p>Obedience is that <hi>Mother-grace, Genetrix omnium virtutum,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> calls it, that which <hi>brings forth all other vertues,</hi> that which ſets the eye to ſee, the ear to hear, the heart to think, the memory to record, the mouth to ſpeak, the foot to walk, the hand to work, the whole man to do that, and only that which is <hi>confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the will of God.</hi> When ſuch holy deſires ariſe in the <hi>heart from the Spirit of God;</hi> then a contrary <hi>deſire</hi> ariſeth alſo from the <hi>fleſh;</hi> according to what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. When <hi>I will doe good,</hi> evill is preſent with me. And my Text among diverſe other <hi>perverted Scriptures,</hi> is wont to be alleadged againſt <hi>obedience</hi> unto the <hi>will of God,</hi> ſo that this <hi>Mother-grace</hi> cannot bring forth the <hi>fruites of the ſpirit;</hi> becauſe <hi>the children are come to the birth and there is no ſtrength to bring forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before we come to the particular handling of theſe words, let us analyſe them, or as much of them as will make up a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate <hi>ſenſe;</hi> and thereby we ſhall ſee, what the words ſo read in our laſt Tranſlation, will amount unto. The Apoſtle having propounded the law of neighbourly love, ver 14. which they tranſgreſſed, ver. 15. The Apoſtle ver. 16. propounds an <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi> for removal of it, an exhortation <hi>to walk in the ſpirit,</hi> which <hi>exhortation</hi> he enforces by this <hi>motive; If ye walk in the ſpirit, ye ſhall not fullfill the luſts of the fleſh.</hi> This conſequence he proves from the nature of <hi>Adverſe contraries,</hi> which naturally expell one the other. For ver. 17. the <hi>fleſh luſts againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit luſts againſt the fleſh; and theſe are contrary the one to the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>effect of theſe contraries</hi> fighting one with the other, is here concluded, according to this tranſlation, <hi>a downright contradiction</hi> to what the Apoſtle before had exhorted unto. He exhorted them to walk in the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and told them, that ſo doing, they ſhould not fullfill the <hi>luſts of the fleſh.</hi> Which <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>fleſh,</hi> ſo contending, it comes to paſs, that <hi>ye cannot do</hi> the things which ye would; that is, ye would walk in the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> that ye might not fullfill <hi>the luſts of the fleſh; but this ye cannot do.</hi> Which yet he had exhorted them unto in the words before. Nor will the marginal reading <hi>[fulfill not]</hi> help this: For whether <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, be part of the exhortation, <hi>fulfill not;</hi> or a motive thereunto, <hi>ye ſhall not fulfill,</hi> the concluſion will be the ſame.</p>
               <p>The <hi>abſurdity</hi> of this reaſoning, will appear, if ye ſhall conceive a Commander in the war; to lead up his men, and <hi>exhort</hi> them to be valiant, and <hi>take a Fort;</hi> and promiſe them a great reward,
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:65717:403"/>if they <hi>take it;</hi> as <hi>Caleb</hi> promiſed, that he, who ſhould ſubdue <hi>Kiriath-Sepher,</hi> and <hi>take it,</hi> to him he would give <hi>Achſah</hi> his daughter to wife, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 15.16. Yea ſuppoſe, that this Commander ſhould adde <hi>threatnings,</hi> even death it ſelf, in caſe this Fort were not taken by them; according to that, <hi>if ye walk after the fleſh, ye ſhall die, Rom.</hi> 8.13. Yet now ſuppoſe that this Commander after all this <hi>exhortation and motives,</hi> ſhould in the winding up of his ſpeach, ſay expreſlly; This <hi>Fort is impregnable, it's impoſsible to win it, ye cannot take it;</hi> Truly a man would think ſuch a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der little other then a Fool, and his Soldiers no wiſer, if they ſhould ſtorm the <hi>Fort,</hi> and hope to carry it upon no better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than theſe are. Yet indeed the caſe is the ſame, if not worſe. Walk in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ye ſhall not fulfill the <hi>luſts</hi> of the <hi>fleſh;</hi> for the <hi>fleſh</hi> luſts againſt the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> luſts againſt the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that ye <hi>cannot do</hi> the things that ye would. Wherefore, ſince it is moſt unreaſonable to think, that the Apoſtle being taught by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, would <hi>reaſon ſo abſurdly,</hi> let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the true meaning of the words; which cannot be done unleſs we render them otherwiſe; as thus: Walk in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ye ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the <hi>fleſh:</hi> For the <hi>fleſh</hi> luſteth againſt the <hi>Spirit: But the Spirit</hi> luſteth againſt the <hi>fleſh</hi> (but theſe are contrary one to other) <hi>that ye may not do</hi> the things that ye would. According to the judgment of the beſt Critick, that I know, theſe words, <hi>(Theſe are contrary the one to the other,)</hi> are to be put in a <hi>parentheſis,</hi> and then, from the <hi>luſting of the Spirit,</hi> will follow, that ye <hi>may not do the things of the fleſh which ye would do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what difference is there between this Tranſlation and the other? 1. In our laſt Tranſlation we have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a knowne note of <hi>diverſity</hi> rendred, <hi>and,</hi> as known a <hi>Conjunction copulative:</hi> and theſe two render different kinds of Axioms, as all <hi>Logicians,</hi> yea, all who have common reaſon, may underſtand. The <hi>fleſh</hi> luſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> luſts againſt the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that's a <hi>copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</hi> The <hi>fleſh</hi> luſts againſt the <hi>Spirit;</hi> but the <hi>Spirit</hi> luſts againſt the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that's <hi>a diſcret Axiom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But there's a far greater difference between <hi>[cannot]</hi> as they render the words, and <hi>[may not,]</hi> as they ought to be turned. <hi>[Ye cannot]</hi> denies <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ſtrength;</hi> ye <hi>[may not]</hi> leaves a poſſibility of doing what they would. For the Spirit ſo, and for this end <hi>luſteth</hi> againſt the <hi>fleſh,</hi>

                  </gap>, that ye may not do the things that ye would, according to the luſting of the <hi>fleſh.</hi> And thus the Greek words ought to be rendred, and generally are ſo rendred by <hi>Pagnin, Caſtellio,</hi> Vulg. Lat. <hi>Vatablus, Beza,</hi> High and Low Duth, French, Italian, and Spaniſh Tranſlations; yea, and by an antient Engliſh Manuſcript; whereas all our printed Engliſh Tranſlations turn it <hi>[cannot.]</hi> If any man think this a ſmall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:65717:403"/>let him ſuſpend his judgement till I ſpeak of it in its due place. The Apoſtle ver. 16. propounds a <hi>Precept.</hi> In the Text we have 1.

               <p>The word here uſed is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which is from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from a <hi>power which comes upon the minde,</hi> whereby the ſoul is carryed out to what is deſired. The luſting of the <hi>fleſh</hi> therefore is not only that of the <hi>lower appetite</hi> which we call the <hi>concupiſcible;</hi> but that alſo of the <hi>iraſcible</hi> is here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as appears by comparing v. 15. If ye bite and devour one another, &amp;c. Yea, the <hi>immoderate luſts</hi> of the <hi>ſuperiour appetite</hi> are here alſo to be underſtood.

               </p>
               <p>The luſting of the <hi>fleſh</hi> againſt the <hi>Spirit,</hi> what is it, but deſiring what is contrary to the deſires and luſtings of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> The <hi>fleſh</hi> deſires things <hi>fleſhly,</hi> which are contrary to the deſires of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which are of <hi>things ſpiritual and heavenly.</hi> As by <hi>the fleſh</hi> the <hi>old Adam</hi> is to be underſtood; ſo by the <hi>Spirit</hi> and its <hi>luſts,</hi> the <hi>luſts</hi> and <hi>wils</hi> of the <hi>new Adam</hi> the <hi>heavenly man,</hi> are here meant.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this is from the miſtake and ſeducing of the <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie:</hi> For the <hi>fanſie</hi> being part of the firſt <hi>Adam, fleſh and blood,</hi> and informed with a <hi>living ſoul,</hi> and being ſenſual, earthly, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and knowing no better thing then earthly objects,

               <p>So that he who <hi>ſins freely</hi> and <hi>without remorſe or cheek,</hi> hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken through manifold lets and hindrances, hath <hi>broken the hedg</hi> of providence about him and is a great treſpaſſer.</p>

               <p>There is an old tradition, that one of the <hi>Thieves</hi> crucified with our Lord, was an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> a <hi>black Thief;</hi> this was the <hi>Evil Thief;</hi> the other an <hi>Edomite,</hi> a <hi>red Thief,</hi> whom they call the <hi>good Thief.</hi> The former, the <hi>black Thief,</hi> the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> the <hi>ſin, periſhed;</hi> the <hi>Edomite,</hi> the firſt man of the Earth, was ſaved.

               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Spirit</hi> luſteth againſt the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that we <hi>may not</hi> do the things of the <hi>fleſh</hi> which otherwiſe <hi>we would</hi> do. In theſe words lies the principal difference between the two Tranſlations. And
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:65717:405"/>that eſpecially in two things: 1. Whether <hi>[cannot]</hi> or <hi>[may not]</hi> be the better tranſlation. 2. What's here meant by <hi>the things that we would do.</hi> As to the firſt, we muſt know, that there is no <hi>Verb</hi> in the Greek Text here, that anſwers to <hi>cannot</hi> or <hi>may not;</hi> but that is only a ſigne of a <hi>Mood</hi> in our Engliſh tongue, as all learned in the Greek tongue eaſily underſtand; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Secondly, what are the <hi>things that we would do?</hi> where the Text ſaith, The <hi>Spirit</hi> luſteth againſt the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that ye <hi>cannot</hi> or <hi>may not</hi> do the <hi>things that ye would.</hi> Surely either both the things which <hi>both fleſh and Spirit</hi> luſt for; or, ſome <hi>one</hi> of them. If both the things which the <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> luſt for, then, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>contrarietys of fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> a man comes off hardly in the performing the luſts either of the <hi>fleſh</hi> or of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> He cannot or <hi>may not freely do the things that he would,</hi> which the <hi>fleſh</hi> luſts for, becauſe the <hi>Spirit</hi> luſts againſt the <hi>fleſh.</hi> And <hi>he cannot freely</hi> do the things that he would, which the <hi>Spirit</hi> luſts for; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>fleſh</hi> luſts againſt the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And ſo <hi>Eraſmus</hi> reaſons in his <hi>Paraphraſe.</hi> Others, as the Tranſlators of the French Bible, in their <hi>Marginal Gloſs,</hi> underſtand here <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> which the <hi>Spirit</hi> luſteth for: And ſo a man <hi>cannot</hi> or <hi>may not</hi> do the <hi>things that he would,</hi> which the <hi>Spirit</hi> luſts for; becauſe the <hi>fleſh</hi> luſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Spirit.</hi> The former of theſe is the more probable; but that neither of theſe can be here meant, will appear by two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 1. Both theſe interpretations overthrow the Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation; which is this; <hi>Walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh.</hi> Now, if neither of the luſts of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> nor of the <hi>Spirit</hi> can be done; the Apoſtle contradicteth his own exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to walk in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> this falſe gloſs ſaith, it cannot be done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond reaſon may be taken from the ſcope, intention, and purpoſe of the Apoſtle, who having exhorted us to <hi>walk in the Spirit,</hi> and promiſed that thereby we ſhould not fulfill the luſts of the <hi>fleſh;</hi> he moves a doubt; The <hi>fleſh</hi> luſts againſt the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which doubt he preſently removes ſaying, but the <hi>Spirit</hi> luſts againſt the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that ye may not do the things that ye would. But that the French Gloſſaries (and all who follow them, who are not a few,) are here quite out, may appear, if ye ſhall conſider, what the <hi>things that ye would,</hi> are, according to that Gloſs, and read the text <hi>cannot,</hi> as Ours do. The <hi>things that ye would,</hi> according to that Gloſs, <hi>are ſpiritual things.</hi> Mark then what a <hi>ſenſe</hi> theſe, laid together, will produce. The <hi>fleſh</hi> luſts againſt the <hi>Spirit;</hi> but the <hi>Spirit</hi> luſts againſt the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that ye <hi>cannot</hi> do the things (ſpiritual things, ſay they) which ye would do. What a derogation is this from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, that the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> luſting againſt the <hi>fleſh,</hi> ſhould make us that we <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> do the <hi>ſpiritual things that</hi> we would? Which is the very
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:65717:406"/>meaning of the words if ſo underſtood; how abſurd, let the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned judg.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By <hi>the things that ye would,</hi> muſt here be underſtood, <hi>the things which the fleſh luſts after,</hi> as may hence appear to the <hi>judicious reader,</hi> becauſe this clauſe, <hi>[That ye may not do the things that ye would,]</hi> is joyned to the <hi>luſting of the Spirit:</hi> which therefore <hi>luſts,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that ye <hi>may not do the things that ye would,</hi> viz, which the fleſh <hi>luſts</hi> to do. So that hence its clear, what are here the <hi>things that we would.</hi> What elſe but the luſts of the <hi>fleſh?</hi> Which if we underſtand here, the words will ſuit exceeding well with the Apoſtles exhortation; <hi>walk in the Spirit and ye ſhall not fulfill the luſt of the fleſh:</hi> For the fleſh, tis true, luſts againſt the <hi>Spirit;</hi> But the <hi>Spirit</hi> luſts againſt the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that ye <hi>may not do the things of the fleſh which ye would do. Piſcator</hi> in his Analyſe of the Text is inforced by the Apoſtles reaſoning, upon this <hi>ſenſe; Care &amp; ſpiritus inter ſe è regiane adverſantur; quo fit, ut qui ſecundum ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum vivit, is non poſsit vivere ſecundum carnem.</hi> The <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are contrary one againſt the other, whence it comes to paſſe that he who lives according to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> he cannot live according to the <hi>fleſh.</hi> Though he make no good uſe of this his obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

Even children can tell us, that they are both ſignes of the <hi>potentiall mood.</hi> I anſwer they are ſo. Yet do they not ſignify one and the ſame thing. For <hi>[Cannot]</hi> denyes <hi>Potentia, ſtrength</hi> and <hi>abillity</hi> to do any thing. <hi>[May not,]</hi> denyes <hi>Poteſtas, authoritie</hi> to do it. If any ſhall queſtion this diſtinction, he may eaſely be ſatisfied out of the German <hi>tongue,</hi> whence we have both theſe words, as from the principal <hi>Mother</hi> of our language; for with them <hi>Ich kan,</hi> is <hi>Poſſum, habeo potentiam,</hi> I can; <hi>Ich mag,</hi> is <hi>licet mihi, habeo poteſtatem;</hi> I have <hi>power</hi> or <hi>authority.</hi> Now who knowes not, that theſe are two diſparate <hi>principles of action,</hi> which may be ſeparated one from other?

               <p>There is in us a proneneſs &amp; a ſtrong inclination to do the luſts of the <hi>fleſh.</hi> They are <hi>things that we would do.</hi> But though there be a <hi>proneſs</hi> and ſtrong inclination to do the luſts of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> yet there is no neceſſity of doing them; why?

               <p>Walk in the <hi>Spirit.</hi> This is the Apoſtles exhortation, ver. 16. To walke in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is to <hi>live in the Spirit;</hi> walking is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive motion a proceeding from vertue to vertue. If thus we do, we ſhall not fulfill the <hi>luſts of the fleſh.</hi> He ſaith not, ye ſhall not have them for they will be troubleſom. But if ye walk in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> ye ſhall not <hi>fulfill</hi> the luſts, by conſenting to them. For if we meet them with <hi>diſſent,</hi> we fulfill them not; they are none of ours. If we conſent unto them, do we conſider, whoſe work we do? Not the work of our God, not our own work. To do the luſts of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> is to do the devills work, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.

               <p>But the Apoſtle forewarns us, that if we hope for fellowſhip with the Lord, we ſhould be ſuch, as he is: now <hi>He is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all.</hi> And therefore he who hath hope of <hi>communion with him, purifies himſelf, as God is pure;</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3.</p>
               <p>This Declaration premiſed, the Apoſtle foreſaw, that three <hi>Objections</hi> would be made againſt his <hi>invitation.</hi>

               <p>The reſult of all this, is; That, would we <hi>hear the living Word,</hi> which was from the beginning; would we <hi>ſee it with our eyes;</hi> would we <hi>look upon it;</hi> would we <hi>handle it</hi> with our hands; would we have ſuch <hi>experimental knowledge</hi> of it; then muſt we <hi>not walk in darkneſs.</hi> So that ye perceive, my Text is part of our Apoſtles anſwer to the ſecond Objection. <hi>They had no ſin,</hi> and therefore they had communion with God already. Nay, ſaith S. <hi>John,</hi> If we ſay, we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us. Wherein we have 1. <hi>A ſuppoſition of a falſe Poſition</hi> that ſome ſaid, they had no ſin. 2. A reaſon of that <hi>falſe Poſition,</hi> which is, ſelf-deceipt; want of truth.</p>

                  <hi>If we ſay, we have not ſinned.</hi> Or to deny that they are the cauſe of the <hi>ſin committed;</hi> but either God himſelf, that he made them ſo, or that he is the <hi>Author of ſin;</hi> a vain imagination, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.11. or they lay the blame upon <hi>nature:</hi> but <hi>falſo de natura ſua conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur humanum genus,</hi> mankinde falſely complains of their nature, ſaith one of the Antients.

               <p>It is true, you'l ſay; But does the Scripture ſpeak ſo? you ſhall judge; What think you of <hi>S. James?</hi> Chap. 3.9. With the tongue, ſaith he, <hi>we</hi> bleſs God; and therewithal curſe <hi>we</hi> men. What think you? Did <hi>S.

                  </note> and I thought in my minde, (or, my heart took counſel in me) and I rebuked the Princes, &amp;c.

I pray you, ſaith he, let us leave off this uſury, or remit this burden. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> uſeth the ſame figure, Chap. 13.23.—27. But cannot this ſpeech be true of <hi>S.

But to ſay, as ſome have done, that <hi>the moſt holy men and women that ever were or are, ſin in every thing they do, or think, or ſpeak, and that daily and hourly,</hi> is an aſſertion moſt falſe and ridiculous, and moſt derogatory from the power of <hi>Gods holy Spirit</hi> in them; nor can it be proved by any divine teſtimony in the holy Word of God.

               </p>
               <p>What reaſon is there that almoſt univerſally, both the antient and later Writers, out of this place eſpecially, <hi>plead,</hi> in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, <hi>for ſin,</hi> and ſay, that it is <hi>impoſsible, but that we muſt have ſin.</hi> Yea, there is a Canon in <hi>Concilio Milevitano,</hi> that concludes down-right from this place, <hi>That we muſt have ſin.</hi> Yea, and whereas <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and after him, <hi>Carthuſian,</hi> underſtand the place of <hi>venial ſin, Lyra</hi> will have it to be underſtood of <hi>mortal

               <p>I will not doubt but many of theſe were pious, learned and good men; inſomuch as <hi>Alexander Hales</hi> ſaid of his Scholar <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, Profectò puto in Domino Boneventura, Adamum non peccaſse.</hi> I think that <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned not in Maſter <hi>Bonaventure.</hi> Nor do I doubt, but that they all, or the moſt of them <hi>fought the good fight of faith.</hi> But I doubt whether many of them had laid hold upon the eternal life, ſo far as to have attained unto the <hi>diſpenſation of the Spirit.</hi> And therefore we may beleive, that they ſpeake, many of them their own experiences, and found daily <hi>temptations from without,</hi> and <hi>corruptions within.</hi>

               <p>That we may the better underſtand this, we muſt know, that ſin againſt God, is conſiderable according to the three diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Father, Son, and Spirit. As to the firſt of theſe; Man by his fall, is become far eſtranged from his God, deeply revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and at a great diſtance from him. For ſo God is a <hi>Spirit and ſpiritually minded,</hi> and oppoſite unto man, who is <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> and <hi>fleſhly and ungodly minded.</hi> And man, on his part, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return, or be reconciled unto God, did not the Lord extend mercy, love, and goodneſs, unto the fallen man; were he not in Chriſt, <hi>reconciling</hi> the world unto himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. did he not allure and draw him to himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44.</p>
               <p>When therefore God the father, by his law (ſo called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8.) <hi>raiſed up</hi> in the fallen man, and teſtifying againſt him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.5,</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.5. corrects him, informes, and inſtructs him to amendment of life; and man meantime neglects, and reſpects and oppoſeth this attraction and drawing of the Father; and knowes not, or duly conſiders not, that this <hi>goodneſs of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eads him to repentance, Rom.</hi> 2.4. This is the <hi>ſin againſt the Father,</hi> which, upon repentance, at the teaching of <hi>John,</hi> is forgiven unto men.</p>
               <p>But when now we are by the diſcipline of the <hi>Father</hi> brought unto the <hi>Son,</hi> and look on him whom we have pierced, who hath ſuffered for our <hi>ſins,</hi> the death of the Croſs; and he now begins to <hi>arm us with the ſame minde,</hi> we are yet in great ignorance and weakneſs, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.3. and when he drawes us, we draw back; when he would, we will not. The contention is long between the houſe of <hi>David</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Saul. In many things we offend all. Nor can we ſay, that we have no ſin,</hi> until the Spirit be powred
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:65717:410"/>from on high; until we be <hi>born from the dead;</hi> until <hi>death be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in victory;</hi> until <hi>we have fellowſhip with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Of this <hi>progreſs,</hi> very much might be ſpoken, which I reſerve for a fit opportunity, if the Lord ſhall give it. Meantime a few words are enough to the wiſe.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore little notice hath been taken, and in theſe dayes much leſs, of the <hi>three diſpenſations</hi> and <hi>ſtates of men in the Father, Son, and Spirit;</hi> that there is a <hi>ſin</hi> againſt the <hi>Father,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Son;</hi> thoſe <hi>children of the Father,</hi> who have their ſins forgiven them through his Name; and are now brought unto the <hi>Son,</hi> and grown ſo ſtrong in him, that they overcome <hi>the evil one;</hi> theſe at length attain to the old age in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally know him who is from the beginning.

                  </gap>, <hi>that is without ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such an eſtate is poſſible and attainable through the <hi>grace of God,</hi> and his holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> that <hi>men may be without ſin.</hi> All belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, yea, even they who diſſent and agree not unto this truth, yet by conſequence even they themſelves confeſs it. For who is there that does not acknowledge, that <hi>communion and fellowſhip with God and Chriſt is poſsible?</hi> which yet cannot be, while men walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Do not all agree, that its poſſible we may be <hi>partakers of the divine nature?</hi> We have the promiſe of God for it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. which yet cannot be until we have eſcaped the corruption that is in the world through luſt. Do not all the faithful believe this, <hi>that they are in Chrict, and Chriſt in them.</hi> Otherwiſe they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, ſaith <hi>S. Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. Now he who ſaith he abides in him, ought himſelf ſo to walk, even as he walked, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6. and his walking was without ſin. Do not all believers hope to inherit eternal life? This is put upon this condition, if ye, <hi>by the Spirit,</hi> ſhall mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. Is not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our example for this very end, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21.</p>
               <p>They therefore are much to blame, who abuſe this Scripture, which <hi>S. John</hi> applyes to <hi>little children</hi> in Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. and extend it even unto all Chriſtians, in <hi>all their ſpiritual ages.</hi> And whereas the Apoſtle makes <hi>uſe of it, to expreſs preſumption,</hi> there are who <hi>abuſe it to harden men and make them deſpair even to be ſaved from their ſins.</hi> Its a Scripture almoſt in every mans mouth, as frequently <hi>uſed or abuſed rather,</hi> as any, except that which is indeed no part of holy Scripture, <hi>That the moſt righteous man that is, ſins ſeven times a day.</hi> They mean, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.16. which we are taught to ſing, in the <hi>Complaint of a ſinner,</hi> and tell the God of <hi>truth</hi> an <hi>untruth.</hi> For in the place named, there is no mention of <hi>falling into ſin,</hi> but into <hi>miſery</hi> and <hi>affliction,</hi> and that not <hi>ſeven times a day,</hi> but only ſeven times; and what is that to this purpoſe?</p>

               <p>O beloved!

Hence we perceive how falſly ſome ſpeak concerning the life and actions of Gods Saints, that they <hi>ſin in all and every thing they do, and think, and ſpeak.</hi> The Apoſtle expounds himſelf in the tenth verſe, how he would be underſtood in the eighth. <hi>If we ſay we have not ſinned;</hi> he ſaith not, that there is any <hi>neceſsity of ſinning.</hi> But if the <hi>Saints of God ſin</hi> in every act, how come they to be <hi>Saints?</hi>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. We have hence matter enough to humble us, if we conſider our <hi>fore-paſt life,</hi> our <hi>prevaricating nature,</hi> our <hi>many frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and weakneſſes,</hi> until the <hi>God of peace make us perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in us what is pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, Hebr.</hi> 13.21.</p>
               <p>Such is the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the Lord Jeſus; and ſuch he teaches his Apoſtles. For when he gives <hi>S. Peter</hi> his charge, his firſt and principal care is of his <hi>Lambs. S. Paul</hi> had learned this leſſon <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,</hi> and practiſed it moſt <hi>wiſely</hi> and <hi>diſcreetly</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Romans, Chap. 7. where he, who is deſcribed <hi>as a childe,</hi> the Apoſtle takes upon himſelf; ſo likewiſe in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. 2. v. 2, 3. Such as they were, ſuch he became unto them. For although he had <hi>wiſdom, ſecret and hidden truth</hi> to impart unto perfect men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. yet he behaved himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, according to their capacity. He could not ſpeak unto them as unto <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> but as unto <hi>carnal even,</hi> as unto <hi>babes in Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2. This the Apoſtle did <hi>Ex profeſſo,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. and 9.19.22. Thus <hi>S. James,</hi> Chap. 3. and thus <hi>S. John</hi> in my text. Theſe things Brethren, I have <hi>in a figure transferred to my ſelf</hi> and to <hi>Apollo, for your ſakes.</hi> And 9.22. To the <hi>weak became I as weak,</hi> that I might <hi>gain the weak;</hi> I am made <hi>all things to all men, that I might by all means ſave ſome. So S. James,</hi> Chap. 3.1.2. My brethren, be not many Maſters, knowing <hi>that we ſhall receive the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi> For in many things <hi>we offend all.</hi> And ver. 9. with the tongue bleſs we God even the Father, and therewith <hi>curſe we men.</hi> And <hi>S.
